1
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:45,145
I had been in the army for three years,
until I got kicked out...

2
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:51,351
because there were some corpses
that had to be buried.

3
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:55,789
My lieutenant gave me
the order to bury them.

4
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:03,029
But I didn’t. Instead I sold them
to some people who approached me.

5
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:06,733
They wanted me to sell them.

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,603
That they would use them for a play...

7
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:14,407
or something like that.

8
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:18,945
They told me not to worry,
that nobody would find out.

9
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,749
So I believed them and
I sold them the corpses.

10
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:27,620
I found out later what they
were really going to do with them.

11
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:30,924
They would disguise them

12
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:36,596
and leave them in the mountains as
if they would have died in combat.

13
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:41,901
I kept silence until they were
declared as "false positives".

14
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:54,981
MUTE FIRE

15
00:01:55,982 --> 00:02:01,688
On February 10th 1906, four men
tried to murder the president of Colombia.

16
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:08,795
The staging of that event, was the
beginning of cinema in the country.

17
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:50,537
<i>The newspaper "Correo Nacional",</i>

18
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:54,807
<i>published in Bogotá on March 6th, 1906,</i>

19
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:59,112
<i>the exact and vivid account</i>
of the execution of four men

20
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:02,282
<i>for the attempt of murder of</i>
the General Rafael Reyes,

21
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,684
<i>by that time president</i>
of Colombia.

22
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:16,763
<i>Marco Arturo Salgar, Carlos Roberto Gonzalez,</i>
Juan Ortiz and Fernando Aguilar.

23
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:21,034
<i>were the four men sentenced</i>
to death, and in consequence

24
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:25,305
<i>shot in the same place where</i>
they committed the crime.

25
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:30,777
<i>The account, whose author's</i>
name remains unknown,

26
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:32,679
<i>is extremely detailed.</i>

27
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:38,418
<i>For example, he describes one by one the kind</i>
of hat that each condemned was wearing.

28
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,588
<i>It’s worth quoting the whole fragment:</i>

29
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:46,492
<i>"They were all wearing black:</i>
Salgar wore a straight wing cinnamon hat.

30
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:49,262
<i>Aguilar wore a Panama hat.</i>

31
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:52,332
<i>Gonzales, a black Tyrolean hat.</i>

32
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:55,235
<i>And Ortiz wore a black hard hat."</i>

33
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:59,839
<i>The reporter also collects</i>
a series of interviews.

34
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:06,145
<i>The most striking is perhaps, the one from</i>
the Captain of Executions, who just says,

35
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:09,983
<i>in a serious tone I'd guess:</i>
"Nothing is sacred".

36
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:18,191
<i>The reporter states: "The shooting</i>
proceeds as normal.

37
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:21,694
<i>Given the signal with his sword</i>
by the Captain of Executions,

38
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:24,631
<i>the first round of shooting</i>
resounds from the rifles.

39
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,470
<i>Afterwards, a group of doctors approaches</i>

40
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,306
<i>and certify that the condemned</i>
are still breathing,

41
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,775
<i>and give the order for</i>
a second shooting,

42
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:38,111
<i>which ends with the immediate</i>
entrance of the four coffins

43
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:40,680
<i>to transport the corpses</i>
to the cemetery."

44
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:54,494
<i>This time, the event is more relevant than</i>
usually, since president Rafael Reyes

45
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:58,298
<i>guided by this moment of political</i>
instability, makes an exception

46
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:02,702
<i>and the shooting doesn't take place in</i>
the courtyard of the School of Infantry,

47
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,771
<i>where it would normally happened.</i>

48
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:08,675
<i>Instead, it's held in a public area,</i>
in front of over 10,000 people.

49
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:21,054
<i>Rafael Reyes saw here the</i>
remains of the last civil war

50
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:25,358
<i>that had ended only four years ago,</i>
and still had the country in agony.

51
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:30,296
<i>Shooting people of his same</i>
political party in public areas,

52
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:32,165
<i>was for him a sign of authority,</i>

53
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:35,768
<i>but also an invitation to end</i>
the traditional divide

54
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,938
<i>between the liberal</i>
and the conservative party.

55
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:45,511
<i>With the purpose of making this shooting</i>
visible to as many people as possible

56
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:51,551
<i>Reyes publishes the book "February 10th",</i>
telling the events through photos.

57
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:56,389
<i>Reyes thought that, just like the people</i>
who witnessed the shooting in person did,

58
00:05:56,589 --> 00:06:01,728
<i>everyone who saw those photos</i>
would immediately support his idea.

59
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:08,367
<i>Nevertheless, the most interesting</i>
part of this series of photos

60
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:12,372
<i>happens after the moment</i>
of the cemetery picture.

61
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:22,048
<i>It’s unknown whose idea it was, but due to the</i>
impact caused by the pictures of the execution

62
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:28,054
<i>president Rafael Reyes, Chief of police</i>
Pedro Pedraza, and photographer Lino Lara

63
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:32,291
<i>decided together to recreate</i>
the moments before the shooting.

64
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:35,394
<i>They decided to recreate</i>
the attack on the president

65
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:38,798
<i>and the capture of the condemned,</i>
to create a story.

66
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:06,859
<i>The outcome was what the historians</i>
called a "false document".

67
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:12,899
<i>From the 22 pictures that make up</i>
the story, 18 are theatrical reenactments.

68
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:19,639
<i>This is the first time of a tale made</i>
through photographs in Colombia.

69
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:23,075
<i>This little narrative gesture,</i>
is acknowledged by tradition

70
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:25,378
<i>as the beginning of</i>
filmmaking in the country.

71
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:18,531
<i>Here lays the body of Rafael Reyes today.</i>

72
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:28,407
<i>This was going to be a movie about the</i>
beginnings of Cinema in Colombia,

73
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,142
<i>about its first images.</i>

74
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:31,911
<i>But as it's being said:</i>

75
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:34,580
<i>To talk about Colombia</i>
we have to talk about war.

76
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:39,252
<i>And to talk about war we need to talk about</i>
armies, about deaths, about cemeteries.

77
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:44,824
<i>At the same time, my house and my</i>
parents house looked like a cemetery.

78
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:50,296
<i>It felt like haunted by an inert current,</i>
like flooded by murky water

79
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,899
<i>or better, by dead water.</i>

80
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:58,304
<i>A few months ago my mother</i>
had an episode of mutism,

81
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:01,173
<i>and without any explanation,</i>
she just stopped talking.

82
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,243
<i>I remember with some nostalgia</i>

83
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:08,881
<i>how she repeated the words of that</i>
Mexican musician while cooking:

84
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:12,485
<i>that said something like:</i>
"I wish you to be happy, very happy...

85
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:14,921
<i>I wish you to find love,</i>
because you deserve it"

86
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:20,059
<i>I read somewhere that the first thing you</i>
forget about a person is the voice.

87
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,099
<i>Affected by this</i>
familiar incident,

88
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:30,169
<i>and because of what connects</i>
all things together

89
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:33,072
<i>maybe the first moments</i>
of national cinema

90
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:36,309
<i>and the muteness of my mother can</i>
be part of the same scenario.

91
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:40,212
<i>Like when you look at a surface</i>
where shadows are being projected

92
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:44,150
<i>and you can't tell each</i>
object from the other apart.

93
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:44,110
<i>One night my father woke up and saw</i>
the light of the bathroom on.

94
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:47,980
<i>When he came closer, he saw my mother in</i>
front of the mirror, shaking.

95
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,783
<i>My father hugged her and</i>
asked her what was going on,

96
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:53,519
<i>he asked her if she</i>
had a bad dream

97
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:55,354
<i>but she couldn’t answer.</i>

98
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:58,457
<i>Since that moment,</i>
she has never spoken again.

99
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:17,643
<i>My mother spent most of the time locked in a</i>
room looking at people through the window.

100
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:40,566
<i>Her presence had become more and</i>
more unbearable for my father

101
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:45,571
<i>who couldn’t avoid feeling sometimes</i>
guilty, and sometimes cheated.

102
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:49,075
<i>The ambiguity of the doctors answers</i>
left a bad feeling behind

103
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:52,078
<i>which made him think</i>
that she was just pretending.

104
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:05,224
<i>One day, a worker of the family suggested</i>
to try with another type of specialist

105
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:10,396
<i>from his point of view, my mother's</i>
muteness was due to a powerful spell.

106
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:18,337
<i>My father agreed, even if it</i>
would make him feel humiliated

107
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,540
<i>because for him, superstitions</i>
were for fools.

108
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:26,112
<i>After two weeks some kind of chaman</i>
or warlock came to my mother.

109
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:31,917
<i>After wandering around the house, where some</i>
kind of weird mantle could certainly be felt

110
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:36,355
<i>like a thick, rancid</i>
smell, he told my father:

111
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:40,059
<i>"Your problems have a</i>
solution, don’t worry.

112
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:42,862
<i>You just have to</i>
sell this house,

113
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:47,533
<i>and leave somewhere visible a valuable</i>
object and a picture of her."

114
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:53,005
<i>My father did so.</i>

115
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:57,243
<i>The house was put on sale, and on a</i>
shelf he left a picture of her

116
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:01,313
<i>and a black stone that she</i>
held like a luck charm.

117
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,419
Please, put your legs up.

118
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:18,250
There’s a line dividing the brain
into a left and a right hemisphere.

119
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:24,023
Usually, in most people,
the left hemisphere

120
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:26,992
dominates language.

121
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:32,464
Language works in two important parts.
One part is in the temporal lobe.

122
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:39,038
The one responsible for perception
and comprehension of any language.

123
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,440
And the other one in the frontal lobe

124
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:46,545
that’s directly responsible
for performing words.

125
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:52,551
So that words can coordinate a coherent
answer according to the understood question.

126
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:56,055
A coherent and adequate answer.

127
00:15:56,155 --> 00:16:01,460
In your case, we’re hoping that you
understand the things we’re asking you.

128
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:03,896
And in case you would
have any difficulties,

129
00:16:03,962 --> 00:16:08,767
we would find some structural injury
in this part that could be either a tumor

130
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:13,172
or a scar of some cerebral stroke
that you might have had.

131
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:18,744
No injury, no tumor.
Analyzing the neurological exam

132
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:24,483
and this last generation
exam, we can conclude

133
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:29,755
that Aracellys brain is completely normal.

134
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:14,933

141
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:52,271
<i>There’s an announcement on</i>
the internet that says:

142
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:56,775
<i>"Recover all important moments of</i>
your life that are kept in old tapes.

<i>All formats, Betacam SP,</i>

145
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:14,126
<i>I contacted the advertiser.</i>

146
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:18,163
<i>That same afternoon, in a country</i>
house on the outskirts of the city,

147
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:19,965
<i>I got to meet Carlos Pelbet,</i>

148
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:23,502
<i>founder of an old audiovisual company</i>
that he and his brother had

149
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:25,771
<i>since the beginning of the 80s.</i>

150
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,913
<i>Carlos told me rapidly about</i>
his interest in films

151
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:38,951
<i>or rather, he told me that at some</i>
point of his life it was of his interest.

152
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:41,453
<i>Also that Pelbet, his company,</i>

153
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:45,557
<i>inaugurated the recording and broadcasting</i>
business of soccer matches in Colombia

154
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:50,696
<i>and that it was right then, when competing with</i>
the big TV channels, that the company broke.

155
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:54,733
<i>He told me that a few years ago he started </i>
collecting anonymous family home movies

156
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:59,638
<i>from the cassettes that he digitizes.</i>
Hours and hours of family events

157
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:05,277
<i>weddings, first communions, birthdays,</i>
baptisms, Christmas and holidays.

158
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:05,264
<i>In a sense, my film is</i>
a relative of all these images,

159
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,467
<i>of the personal images of everyday rites.</i>

160
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:12,537
<i>Carlos tells me that each week, a</i>
different youngster arrives at his door

161
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:14,940
<i>wanting to digitize</i>
images of his family

162
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,842
<i>with an idea similar to mine:</i>

163
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:20,278
<i>To make a film about their mothers,</i>
fathers or grandparents.

164
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:25,050
<i>Apparently more people are doing the</i>
same film as me at this moment.

165
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:28,253
<i>We are all thinking about the same images.</i>

166
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:54,379
<i>These are some images taken by my mother.</i>

167
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:59,084
<i>A movie about a play in</i>
a rural school she worked at.

168
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:03,822
<i>Back then, she sympathized with the</i>
insurgent groups of the country.

169
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:10,962
<i>That’s me.</i>

170
00:22:55,841 --> 00:23:01,813
<i>In one of the movie cans,</i>
it was written on a white tape:

171
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:04,483
<i>"Marquetalia, 1964".</i>

172
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:09,588
<i>Those are the place and the date</i>
where the famous FARC was founded.

173
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:15,026
<i>Apparently, the play is about a popular</i>
narration about the first combats

174
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:18,130
<i>between the FARC guerilla </i>
and the National Army.

175
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,233
<i>The story is the following:</i>

176
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:32,978
<i>Having the intention of avoiding the</i>
expansion of the communist guerrilla,

177
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:37,449
<i>on May 18th, 1964 president</i>
Guillermo León Valencia

178
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:40,619
<i>sends over a thousand soldiers</i>
to the Tolima plateau

179
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:45,791
<i>in search for a suspected FARC camp with</i>
48 members of the insurgent movement in it.

180
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:51,830
<i>After nine days of intense</i>
wandering, the group of soldiers,

181
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,966
<i>lead by Lieutenant Colonel</i>
José Joaquín Matallana,

182
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:59,171
<i>starts suspecting that they’re wrong, </i>
that there’s no such camp.

183
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:04,476
<i>They quickly realize that the insurgents</i>
are not full time soldiers,

184
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:06,478
<i>and that most of them actually</i>

185
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:10,382
<i>have a disguised life as farmers </i>
among the civilians.

186
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,253
<i>A question immediately arose:</i>

187
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:20,225
<i>How to tell the population, most of them</i>
farmers, from the guerrillas apart?

188
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:25,530
<i>Facing this, Colonel</i>
José Joaquín Matallana,

189
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:28,567
<i>who considered himself as an</i>
analytic and methodic person

190
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:31,970
<i>and an innovating strategist,</i>
thought to have the answer.

191
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:37,209
<i>He explains to his soldiers: "This problem</i>
is essentially about appearances".

192
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:42,113
<i>Matallana ordered his soldiers to go</i>
after every man and woman of the area

193
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:45,984
<i>and force them to wear the</i>
guerrilla uniform in front of them.

194
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:50,255
<i>Matallana assured his soldiers,</i>

195
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:53,592
<i>that the uniform had the</i>
strength and essential capacity

196
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:55,627
<i>to reveal someone's identity.</i>

197
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,730
<i>According to his logic,</i>
wearing the uniform

198
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:03,368
<i>would immediately reveal if the person </i>
was a real guerilla soldier or not.

199
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:33,064
<i>After two weeks they had captured 52 people,</i>
including five children and eight elderly.

200
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:37,068
<i>This idea would be known later</i>
as the Matallana logic.

201
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:39,804
<i>And what could have been a</i>
brilliant military operation,

202
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:42,674
<i>ended up being one of the biggest</i>
political failures in history

203
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:47,913
<i>because, in less than two years, those 48</i>
soldiers would later turn into five thousand.

204
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:56,021
<i>From then on, the idea of the disguised</i>
guerrilla would become an obsession

205
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:58,557
<i>in the development of</i>
public opinion in the country.

206
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:02,160
<i>Throughout the years, the question</i>
would be incessantly repeated:

207
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,030
<i>Who’s really from the guerilla, </i>
and who’s not?

208
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:32,958
<i>More than 20 years ago</i>
my mother filmed me.

209
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:35,560
<i>Today, I’m filming her.</i>

210
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:47,572
<i>Seeing myself in that play, </i>
playing role of a farmer

211
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:51,109
<i>captured by the army and forced </i>
to dress like a guerilla man

212
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:55,547
<i>I couldn’t avoid thinking of the</i>
recent events of the war in Colombia.

213
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:11,296
<i>Thousands of innocent young people were </i>
captured by the National Army of Colombia

214
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:16,234
<i>and taken to different parts </i>
of the country to be murdered later.

215
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:19,204
<i>Then, their bodies were</i>
dressed up like guerilla-soldier

216
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:22,974
<i>and presented in front of the</i>
media like military successes.

217
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:26,745
<i>It was a systematic</i>
falsification of war events.

218
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:30,715
<i>Stagings, using real victims</i>
to create a story.

219
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:42,727
<i>By the year 2008, this practice</i>
was so common in the National Army

220
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:46,965
<i>that the victims of this type of</i>
crime counted to the present day

221
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:50,468
<i>are more than the missing people </i>
during the dictatorship in Chile.

222
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:41,519
<i>During the 1960s,</i>

223
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:44,656
<i>in search of images of</i>
true revolutionaries,

224
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:47,392
<i>two French filmmakers</i>
travelled to Riochiquito,

225
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:49,260
<i>located in the north of</i>
the province of Cauca.

226
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:55,400
<i>They recorded there the activities</i>
of the recently founded FARC.

227
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:02,974
In 1964, the government
started a persecution again.

228
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:09,814
This time, with 16,000 men ordered to wipe
out completely with the organization.

229
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:14,486
But again, they encountered with
the resistance of the farmers

230
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:21,459
and instead of ending it, the movement
has spread and got even stronger.

231
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:28,466
Since in June 1964 we had already...

232
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:34,506
created a program that was already
well known by the public opinion.

233
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:37,942
Many other revolutionary
movements have also joined in.

234
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:42,447
They also agree with it and
will fight together with us.

235
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:46,985
<i>According to a French article called</i>
"Cinema declares war on us"

236
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:48,820
<i>the screening of this movie</i>

237
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:52,524
<i>generated an unexpected anguish</i>
among young people in Paris.

238
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:56,394
<i>Apparently, proving the</i>
existence of revolutionary life

239
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:59,697
<i>radically buried any other</i>
alternative of life.

240
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:02,267
<i>For the young Parisians of that time</i>

241
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,804
<i>nothing could be compared to the idea</i>
of leading a life in the armed struggle

242
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:07,705
<i>for political transformation.</i>

243
00:30:08,072 --> 00:30:11,009
<i>Hence,</i>
the movie made them feel

244
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:14,212
<i>that their lives and</i>
experiences were insignificant

245
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:17,148
<i>compared to those of Colombian guerilla.</i>

246
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,694
<i>Louise Canet, a western</i>
movies director,

247
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:32,664
<i>then recently joined to</i>
the French Socialist Party

248
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:34,766
<i>declared after watching the movie:</i>

249
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:39,971
<i>"It’s common to hear people saying that</i>
South American people are violent by nature

250
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:43,074
<i>that they have a violent heritage from</i>
the Spanish and the Indigenous people.

251
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:46,411
<i>I don’t know what to think.</i>
But I’m sure of something:

252
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:48,713
<i>It’s a fertile land for rebels".</i>

253
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:48,499
<i>This is the place where the attempt against</i>
president Rafael Reyes happened

254
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:52,236
<i>and where the four men who </i>
did it were shot later on.

255
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:56,174
<i>In the same place, just a few </i>
weeks later, photographer Lino Lara

256
00:32:56,207 --> 00:33:00,244
<i>and Commandant Pedro Pedraza </i>
recreated the attempt of murder.

257
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:08,419
<i>According to the records</i>
of the Correo Nacional,

258
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:10,922
<i>the pictures were</i>
taken in two days

259
00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:13,358
<i>and only during morning hours.</i>

260
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:17,195
<i>From those two days, a brief</i>
correspondence between Lino Lara

261
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:18,930
<i>and General Pedro Pedraza</i>
hast been preserved.

262
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:23,334
<i>Here, after making it clear</i>
that he’s also a photographer

263
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:26,971
<i>and not a superstitious person,</i>
officer Pedraza asks himself:

264
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:29,741
<i>is there any risk in imitating the dead?</i>

265
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:33,378
<i>There is no known answer from</i>
Lino Lara to this question.

266
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:38,316
<i>In fact, very little </i>
is known about him.

267
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:42,453
<i>In contrast, a lot has been</i>
written about these photographs

268
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:46,924
<i>and the importance of violent </i>
events reenactments in the country.

269
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:59,871
<i>It's easy to think that the idea of</i>
this first tale has been influenced

270
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,907
<i>by some of the first films</i>
of Thomas Alva Edison

271
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:06,210
<i>in which episodes of famous</i>
executions are recreated.

272
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:11,609
<i>For example: Here they recreate </i>
the death of Leon Czolgosz

273
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:16,747
<i>a Polish anarchist sentenced to death for the</i>
murder of the president of the United States,

274
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:20,384
<i>William McKinley, on</i>
September the 6th, 1901.

275
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:53,217
<i>Edison's goal was to</i>
publicize the electric chair

276
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:58,256
<i>to make it the new method of execution in</i>
the country and replace the gallows.

277
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:02,593
<i>He knew that neither technology, nor</i>
his inventions were neutral

278
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:06,731
<i>and since electricity could be</i>
turned into a killing device

279
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,133
<i>the cinematograph and the pictures</i>

280
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:14,472
<i>could also unleash very useful energies </i>
for the project of a country.

281
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:08,526
<i>These landscapes of the Magdalena river</i>

282
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:12,663
<i>were recorded in photographs </i>
by Rafael Reyes in 1909.

283
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:17,602
<i>Back then, the former president dedicated himself</i>
to travel around the unknown national territory

284
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:22,240
<i>thinking about how Colombian cinema could be</i>
used according to the project of a country.

285
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:25,876
<i>The result of this 22-day-long</i>
adventure was a book called:

286
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:29,780
<i>"Presidential excursions,</i>
notes from a travel journal."

287
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:36,821
<i>The book contains a detailed inventory of</i>
the main natural resources of the country

288
00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:41,125
<i>in relation to the industrial means</i>
necessary for its exploitation.

289
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:42,326
<i>For instance:</i>

290
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:46,664
<i>there's a list of the total length of</i>
the railway tracks of each province

291
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:52,036
<i>in relation to the increase of hectares</i>
cultivated year by year since 1895.

292
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:13,724
<i>Reyes intended to boost</i>
several trades,

293
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:15,893
<i>especially in the areas</i>
of banana plantations.

294
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:19,397
<i>Therefore, articles from</i>
French and English magazines

295
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,766
<i>recommending the consumption</i>
of bananas were included

296
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:26,003
<i>arguing that bananas were the most</i>
hygienic and nutritious fruit of them all.

297
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:31,142
<i>At the same time, this documentation is</i>
accompanied by a series of photographs

298
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:35,513
<i>that privilege images of landscapes,</i>
agricultural colonies, train tracks

299
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:39,116
<i>prominent personalities of the</i>
industrial world and workers.

300
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:42,520
<i>This book was the first visual</i>
record of the national territory.

301
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:46,557
<i>Rafael Reyes described it as</i>
an "explained cinematograph".

302
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:19,056
Banana field blueprint

303
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:03,200
<i>The truth was, Rafael Reyes did not only</i>
intend to create a catalog of wealths

304
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,903
<i>to allure foreign multinationals.</i>

305
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:09,840
<i>His true purpose was to create a</i>
unified image of the country,

306
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,209
<i>which due to the characteristics</i>
of its geography

307
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:15,312
<i>suffered from a great lack of</i>
communication among its regions

308
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:20,518
<i>which by the time was already producing great</i>
losses in large portions of the territory.

309
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:26,791
<i>Rafael Reyes was looking for something a</i>
little more elusive and much more dangerous.

310
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:32,730
<i>He was sure that all people of the</i>
country should be united by something,

311
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:36,434
<i>a supposed "national essence" that </i>
would prevent their dismemberment.

312
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:38,869
<i>He asked himself: What are we?</i>

313
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:40,905
<i>The result of a discrete genocide?</i>

314
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:44,241
<i>Or are we the occasional guardians</i>
of infinite clusters of gold

315
00:40:44,308 --> 00:40:47,678
<i>and immense expanses of water</i>
that turn into fruits?

316
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:57,354
<i>Driven by the scientific spirit of the time</i>

317
00:40:57,421 --> 00:41:02,359
<i>Reyes saw in the photographic device</i>
the best tool to look for that essence.

318
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:14,071
<i>He thought: If photographs can capture,</i>
better than anything else in the world

319
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:19,076
<i>the outstanding feature of the identity of</i>
a subject that is, of course, his face

320
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:21,445
<i>why wouldn’t it be able,</i>
with enough effort,

321
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:25,683
<i>to reveal the image of the true face</i>
of these lands and thus, its identity?

322
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:32,790
<i>A group of the right images</i>
can unify the country.

323
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:04,855
<i>Thus, Rafael Reyes begins like this</i>
with his obsession with portraits

324
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:10,794
<i>which would result in the most significant</i>
image of the book and possibly of the time:

325
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:19,303
<i>The portrait of cacique</i>
José Dolores and his wife

326
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,673
<i>holding a portrait of former </i>
President Rafael Reyes.

327
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:26,510
<i>It has been thought, quite often,</i>

328
00:42:26,543 --> 00:42:28,913
<i>that Reyes was saying only one</i>
thing with this photograph:

329
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,315



<i>I am Colombia.</i>

330
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:03,180
<i>The photographs of Rafael Reyes </i>
and Lino Lara

331
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:06,550
<i>represented a technological</i>
innovation for the country.

332
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:08,152
<i>From this moment on,</i>

333
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:12,756
<i>the way in which the different events were</i>
narrated would be radically transformed.

334
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:18,329
<i>They marked the beginning of an informative</i>
treatment based on the display of images.

335
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:49,259
<i>For those who, like myself, have experienced the</i>
war in Colombia exclusively through images

336
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:52,663
<i>those of television,</i>
magazines and newspapers;

337
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:56,000
<i>the figure of Rafael Rayes</i>
asks us a question:

338
00:43:56,100 --> 00:44:01,205
<i>Is there any link between the production of</i>
images and the war events in the country?

339
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:15,319
<i>Over the years, the question about who’s</i>
a guerilla combatant and who’s not,

340
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:17,121
<i>suffers a transformation.</i>

341
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:21,558
<i>It mutates, becoming the obsession</i>
for one specific image:

342
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:24,194
<i>The image of the dead guerilla.</i>

343
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:29,600
<i>The image of the insurgent murdered</i>
at hands of agents of the State

344
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,002
<i>is spread through all</i>
screens of the country.

345
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:35,806
<i>In a short time, it manages to dominate</i>
the imagination of public opinion

346
00:44:35,806 --> 00:44:39,243
<i>and its production is furiously</i>
demanded from everywhere.

347
00:44:41,145 --> 00:44:43,647
<i>"¡More images!", says the</i>
redactor to the journalist,

348
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:46,517
<i>the editor to the photographer,</i>
and the General to the soldier.

349
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:49,853
<i>"I want to see a dead guerrilla</i>
every day", says the president.

350
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:52,056
<i>But it’s also to be</i>
heard in schools

351
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:57,327
<i>bars, stores, churches, houses;</i>
among friends and family.

352
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:04,768
<i>Then, the horror came.</i>

353
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:09,773
<i>It was discovered that many of those bodies,</i>
and in consequence many of those images

354
00:45:09,773 --> 00:45:12,309
<i>didn’t belong to authentic guerilla-soldier.</i>

355
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:15,045
<i>That the bodies were </i>
of young innocents disguised,

356
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:17,047
<i>that everything was a staging</i>

357
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:22,920
<i>and that the testimonies of the soldiers</i>
were also reproductions of other combats.

358
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:36,033
<i>The response of the audience</i>
to that truth was apathy.

359
00:45:36,133 --> 00:45:40,904
<i>We all said: Those are the mothers of</i>
the youngsters called "false positives".

360
00:45:41,038 --> 00:45:45,943
<i>Nobody said: "I’m the one who was found dead</i>
in a distant area disguised as a guerilla".

361
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:49,413
<i>Nobody said: I’m the one</i>
that’s missing.

362
00:45:49,546 --> 00:45:50,748
<i>We just said:</i>

363
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:54,885
<i>Those have to be the family members of</i>
the murdered people that are protesting

364
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:57,788
<i>just asking to recover the good </i>
name of their beloved ones.

365
00:45:57,921 --> 00:45:58,989
<i>Nobody said:</i>

366
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:04,027
<i>I’m one of the "false positives", one of</i>
the State murders that were celebrated.

367
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:12,402
<i>Real deaths put in combat scenarios</i>

368
00:46:12,669 --> 00:46:17,808
<i>as if the war events in the country would</i>
have been replaced by some kind of parody

369
00:46:17,908 --> 00:46:20,878
<i>by an evil imitation created by war itself.</i>

370
00:46:21,211 --> 00:46:25,883
<i>As if after all these years, the war would</i>
be trying to create its own representations

371
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,885
<i>its own copies.</i>

372
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:34,858
<i>In 1906, Rafael Reyes</i>
created a "false document"

373
00:46:34,925 --> 00:46:37,427
<i>to produce a story</i>
about an execution.

374
00:46:37,594 --> 00:46:38,762
<i>A century later,</i>

375
00:46:38,862 --> 00:46:44,268
<i>the Colombian Army created the "false positives" </i>
to simulate the victory of the war.

376
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:49,706
<i>Thus, the "false positives" seem to be</i>
part of a national fiction tradition

377
00:46:49,773 --> 00:46:52,276
<i>that begins with the photographs </i>
of Lino Lara,

378
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:54,845
<i>with the first staging of violent events</i>

379
00:46:54,878 --> 00:46:57,314
<i>and the birth of Colombian Cinema.</i>

380
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:15,859
<i>My mother had a recurrent dream that,</i>
according to her, chased her.

381
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:20,430
<i>In the dream, a coffin was driven</i>
around the streets of the city.

382
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:28,038
<i>Every time she told it, she said:</i>

383
00:48:28,272 --> 00:48:32,042
<i>"I think of that image as if I was</i>
the dead person inside of the coffin."

384
00:48:32,142 --> 00:48:36,980
<i>"I imagine the people on the streets watching</i>
and thinking in silence: someone died."

385
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:50,394
<i>I asked her if she ever had</i>
that dream again. She told me yes.

386
00:48:50,527 --> 00:48:52,396
<i>But that it didn’t</i>
matter to her anymore.

387
00:48:52,462 --> 00:48:57,801
<i>Over time, that image had become</i>
boring to her, kind of obvious, pathetic.

388
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:04,441
<i>Nevertheless,</i>

389
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:09,579
<i>she had lately started to feel curious about</i>
the identity of the man who drove the car.

390
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:13,550
<i>She told me: "I’ve been wondering</i>
lately how his hands would be, his lips,

391
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:17,354
<i>the shape of his teeth. </i>
I want to know his name".

392
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:35,472
Are you having fun?

393
00:50:04,067 --> 00:50:07,204
<i>More, more, more!</i>

394
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:26,323
<i>- Are you all right?</i>
- Yes!

395
00:50:26,556 --> 00:50:30,227
Come then, so you can
get some water on you.

396
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:47,277
<i>My mother has spent the last few months</i>
between hospitals and this house.

397
00:50:47,344 --> 00:50:50,080
<i>The house of Maria, her best friend.</i>

398
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:52,516
<i>After several months,</i>

399
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:56,920
<i>the doctors stated that if she didn’t</i>
talk was because she didn’t want to.

400
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:00,023
<i>Because they couldn’t find</i>
any reason for it.

401
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:07,898
<i>Other doctors, the most pessimistic</i>
and less reserved ones,

402
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:10,967
<i>made us understand that she just</i>
didn’t want to live anymore.

403
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:29,386
<i>The truth is,</i>
the more time passes,

404
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:32,489
<i>the feeling that my mother</i>
is disappearing grows.

405
00:51:32,689 --> 00:51:36,960
<i>Somehow, every day her presence</i>
resembles more of a ghost.

406
00:51:37,227 --> 00:51:41,865
<i>It’s as if she would have escaped time,</i>
and would be merely a thought of mine.

407
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,769
<i>Today is her birthday.</i>

408
00:51:50,307 --> 00:51:52,909
We thank the Lord because...

409
00:51:54,811 --> 00:51:57,247
He has given us...

410
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:02,586
an exact and clear message...

411
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:09,493
and we have understood that message.

412
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:13,930
It's not that we have a screw loose.

413
00:52:14,531 --> 00:52:20,937
It’s not that we’re crazy,
or that we’re less than you.

414
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:24,641
It's not that.

415
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:30,514
It’s just that we accepted
to walk with Jesus Christ.

416
00:52:30,881 --> 00:52:35,952
That’s the difference between you and us.

417
00:52:36,286 --> 00:52:39,122
That’s why, even with fear

418
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:44,628
we’re here in front of the presence of God

419
00:52:45,262 --> 00:52:48,899
and maybe you, my friend, will say:

420
00:52:49,132 --> 00:52:52,102
The evangelics again...

421
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:55,438
Making noise again...

422
00:52:56,273 --> 00:53:01,678
Those people who come here just to sing...

423
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,880
who just…

424
00:53:04,281 --> 00:53:09,653
<i>During the last week, an evangelist called</i>
Ricardo Javier has been harassing my mother.

425
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:13,823
<i>He stands in front of the house to talk to</i>
her about the power of the word of Jesus.

426
00:53:18,628 --> 00:53:20,030
<i>He was saying yesterday:</i>

427
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:23,300
"Gods kingdom is like a thief.

428
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:28,138
<i>If we would know when a thief is coming,</i>
nobody would ever be robbed.

429
00:53:28,405 --> 00:53:33,376
<i>Gods kingdom comes when we’re not</i>
expecting it, so keep your eyes open."

430
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:49,593
♪ I remember when I saw
you for the first time

431
00:53:50,193 --> 00:53:55,265
♪ and my eyes teared up when I looked at you.

00:53:55,532 --> 00:54:00,470

00:54:06,543 --> 00:54:11,348

00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:32,969
♪ To bring joy to this

439
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:55,852
The strange thing was that I didn’t
notice her as worried as I was.

440
00:55:56,152 --> 00:56:00,390
If I wake up mute I would
probably go crazy.

441
00:56:00,557 --> 00:56:04,461
I noticed it was an attitude
that she was assuming.

442
00:56:04,627 --> 00:56:08,064
I could never knew if was just
in front of me or everyone

443
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:09,566
or facing life.

444
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:12,235
Maybe she was punishing us all.

445
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:15,872
But then she stopped speaking.

446
00:56:15,972 --> 00:56:20,877
I don’t think she can’t speak,
I think that she has decided not to speak.

447
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:23,980
And I think it’s a voluntary decision.

448
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:28,651
I thought, however, that it
could be a medical issue.

449
00:56:29,619 --> 00:56:32,222
We took her to the doctor

450
00:56:32,522 --> 00:56:37,627
I talked to Héctor, to César 
and to other people.

451
00:56:38,194 --> 00:56:40,296
To everyone I thought could know.

452
00:56:41,131 --> 00:56:43,633
They all came to the
same conclusion:

453
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:47,337
Aracelly's problem
is inexplicable.

454
00:56:47,771 --> 00:56:53,042
It’s not physiological, and it
doesn’t seem psychological either.

455
00:56:53,343 --> 00:56:57,447
Always, always, always, I think
that she always understands us.

456
00:56:57,647 --> 00:57:00,850
She hasn't lost the
capacity of understanding

457
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:04,821
nor has she lost any
other kind of routines.

458
00:57:05,021 --> 00:57:08,725
She reads, she walks, she thinks,

459
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:11,661
she insinuates, she takes initiatives.

460
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:16,266
I think that she is taking somehow revenge.

461
00:57:16,566 --> 00:57:21,237
And I think that, somehow, what she’s pretending
is to make life unbearable to everyone.

462
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:24,874
If that’s the case, she
should have said it,

463
00:57:24,874 --> 00:57:27,243
and it would have been better

464
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:29,746
that we would just
have ended everything.

465
00:57:29,846 --> 00:57:32,615
I think that families begin

466
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:38,254
and families dissolve, families
should not self-destruct.

467
00:57:38,388 --> 00:57:42,459
I think we never talked enough about love.

468
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:45,628
Because if we had talked
enough about love

469
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:47,897
we would have understood
it from the beginning.

470
00:57:48,264 --> 00:57:53,136
Love is born, it grows and it
dies like everything in nature.

471
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:59,676
I believe that the academic attitude is not
only repeating texts in the universities

472
00:58:00,109 --> 00:58:03,546
but to live academically,
and that we have lacked.

473
00:58:14,557 --> 00:58:17,160
<i>This is the first recorded</i>
game of the Atlético Nacional,

474
00:58:17,193 --> 00:58:19,796
<i>in this filmic document</i>
of the Pelbet company.

475
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:24,434
<i>We will present indistinctly,</i>
according to journalistic consideration

476
00:58:24,534 --> 00:58:27,871
<i>the main games, the ones</i>
we consider essential

477
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:31,875
<i>for the conquer of the title of 1981.</i>

478
00:58:32,609 --> 00:58:35,879
<i>The team wins 3-0 in his opening game.</i>

479
00:58:35,912 --> 00:58:38,715
<i>The second game in</i>
Armenia was tied 0-0.

480
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:43,319
<i>The final game of the championship tied</i>
1-1 against Medellín in the first round

481
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:46,890
<i>and in the second round </i>
they lost against Quindío 0-2.

482
00:58:47,523 --> 00:58:52,929
<i>The first goal was scored by</i>
Victor Luna and Guillermo La Rosa

483
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:55,532
<i>from the midfield, inside the area</i>

484
00:58:55,598 --> 00:59:00,470
<i>so that he can be, as</i>
usually, close to the goal.

485
00:59:02,071 --> 00:59:04,774
<i>Let’s go for the second victory Verdolaga!</i>

486
00:59:05,441 --> 00:59:10,146
<i>Attention, La Rosa has the ball,</i>
Herrera enters the area.

487
00:59:10,413 --> 00:59:15,451
<i>He kicks gently, but what a</i>
great location of the ball!

488
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:21,658
<i>These images belong to the thirty-fourth</i>
Colombian professional football tournament

489
00:59:21,658 --> 00:59:24,260
<i>having the Atlético</i>
Nacional team as champion,

490
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:26,529
<i>after a victory against</i>
América de Cali

491
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:29,032
<i>with a difference of one goal to zero.</i>

492
00:59:32,368 --> 00:59:36,673
<i>During the tournament, Atlético Nacional</i>
would play a total of 61 matches.

493
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:40,977
<i>They would win 28, draw 17 and lose 16.</i>

494
00:59:42,178 --> 00:59:45,448
<i>The particularity of this</i>
tournament is due to Carlos Pelbet

495
00:59:45,448 --> 00:59:48,284
<i>and his small family</i>
company, Pelbet S.A.

496
00:59:48,551 --> 00:59:52,088
<i>Along with his brother, four</i>
cameramen and a commentator

497
00:59:52,155 --> 00:59:56,993
<i>Carlos Pelbet recorded all the matches</i>
of Atlético Nacional during the tournament.

498
00:59:56,993 --> 00:59:58,661
<i>This was the first time</i>

499
00:59:58,695 --> 01:00:01,931
<i>that professional cameras were taken</i>
to the football stadiums in the country

500
01:00:02,031 --> 01:00:07,003
<i>and those were also the first efforts to</i>
broadcast the football events in Colombia.

501
01:00:10,707 --> 01:00:13,910
<i>The transmissions made by Carlos</i>
Pelbet were very limited,

502
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:16,813
<i>since they were designed to</i>
reach a few radio studios only

503
01:00:16,846 --> 01:00:21,150
<i>where the announcers told the listeners</i>
what were seeing on the screens.

504
01:00:21,551 --> 01:00:25,722
<i>Carlos Pelbet says to himself:</i>
I transformed the history of this country

505
01:00:25,722 --> 01:00:28,124
<i>through football and cameras.</i>

506
01:00:28,224 --> 01:00:33,062
<i>I brought the replay and the slow motion.</i>
I educated the eye of many young people.

507
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:36,466
<i>Carlos stops in this image.</i>

508
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:42,138
<i>Apparently, the foul can't</i>
be seen clear enough.

509
01:00:42,238 --> 01:00:45,008
<i>But let’s have a look </i>
from the reverse angle.

510
01:00:45,274 --> 01:00:49,946
<i>The one from the cameras at the other side</i>
of the goal, placed by Pelbet’s company.

511
01:00:50,013 --> 01:00:52,682
<i>41 minutes of the</i>
additional stage.

512
01:00:52,715 --> 01:00:55,284
<i>Four minutes left for</i>
Nacional to be the champion.

513
01:00:56,819 --> 01:01:01,991
<i>Look at that karate blow from Gonzalez</i>
Aquino to the peruvian Cesar Cueto.

514
01:01:03,393 --> 01:01:06,496
<i>Just a few minutes left </i>
of the championship final.

515
01:01:08,398 --> 01:01:09,599
<i>After this fall</i>

516
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:12,468
<i>the referee interprets a</i>
penalty kick and sanctions it.

517
01:01:12,468 --> 01:01:15,004
<i>Immediately, the coach of the</i>
America enters the field

518
01:01:15,138 --> 01:01:17,907
<i>and tells all his players</i>
to leave the game,

519
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:20,543
<i>arguing lack of guarantees</i>
from the referee.

520
01:01:21,411 --> 01:01:23,279
<i>The game was never finished.</i>

521
01:01:28,718 --> 01:01:33,523
<i>After this event, Carlos Pelbet was harassed</i>
for several days by hundreds of fanatics

522
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:36,325
<i>who wanted to obtain the</i>
recordings of the game,

523
01:01:36,325 --> 01:01:39,529
<i>with the intention of studying the</i>
images very carefully themselves

524
01:01:39,595 --> 01:01:42,031
<i>together with friends and family.</i>

525
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:45,301
<i>Repeat them again and</i>
again, frame per frame,

526
01:01:45,401 --> 01:01:48,304
<i>and dissecting that instant</i>
as many times as necessary

527
01:01:48,304 --> 01:01:53,209
<i>until it spoke for itself and said</i>
if the fault was simulated or real.

528
01:01:57,046 --> 01:02:01,084
<i>It's impossible for Carlos Pelbet </i>
to determine that kind of issue.

529
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:04,654
<i>For him, there is simply no</i>
difference between someone who falls

530
01:02:04,754 --> 01:02:06,989
<i>and someone who</i>
pretends to fall.

531
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:17,333
<i>More than 30 years after</i>
those first recordings

532
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:21,804
<i>Carlos keeps working with images</i>
coming from football events.

533
01:02:42,892 --> 01:02:46,162
- Was my exit okay?
- It was fine.

534
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:48,965
<i>Cut.</i>

535
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:52,969
<i>Roll camera, roll sound.</i>

536
01:02:53,736 --> 01:02:56,139
- Do I have to clap again?
- <i>Yes, please.</i>

537
01:02:57,173 --> 01:02:58,474
- <i>Ready?</i>
- Yes.

538
01:02:58,474 --> 01:03:03,412
<i>When I started this movie, I was trying to</i>
find out if my mother was pretending or not.

539
01:03:03,579 --> 01:03:07,216
<i>If she had really turned mute,</i>
if she was really dying.

540
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:10,753
<i>Neither my father nor other relatives</i>
or close friends believed her

541
01:03:10,853 --> 01:03:14,223
<i>nor the doctors nor even</i>
the religious people.

542
01:03:14,323 --> 01:03:16,893
<i>But, in a similar way to</i>
what many experienced

543
01:03:16,926 --> 01:03:19,762
<i>when analyzing the images of the national </i>
Football championship final game

544
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:22,532
<i>there may be no difference</i>
between someone who suffers

545
01:03:22,532 --> 01:03:24,500
<i>and someone who</i>
pretends to suffer.

546
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:32,542
<i>So, Carlos points out that</i>
it's useless to judge an image

547
01:03:32,575 --> 01:03:35,411
<i>wanting to discern what's</i>
real in it and what’s not.

548
01:03:35,678 --> 01:03:40,082
<i>For him, images are jus not a good</i>
place to look for the truth.

549
01:03:41,517 --> 01:03:45,555
<i>Then, from the projects of</i>
Thomas Alva Edison, Rafael Reyes

550
01:03:45,688 --> 01:03:49,625
<i>and the recent images that</i>
dramatize deaths and violent events

551
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:51,894
<i>perhaps it would be</i>
better to ask ourselves:

552
01:03:51,961 --> 01:03:55,064
<i>What effects do these</i>
images have on the living?

553
01:03:55,631 --> 01:03:59,535
<i>Do they have any participation</i>
in the events they represent?

554
01:05:14,043 --> 01:05:16,212
<i>For example these women.</i>

555
01:05:16,345 --> 01:05:17,847
<i>All three are actresses</i>

556
01:05:17,847 --> 01:05:20,383
<i>who pose as if they had lost</i>
a family member in the war

557
01:05:20,449 --> 01:05:22,251
<i>and were claiming for them.</i>

558
01:05:30,826 --> 01:05:32,495
…or something like that.

559
01:05:33,229 --> 01:05:36,799
They told me not to worry,
that nobody would find out.

560
01:05:37,366 --> 01:05:40,403
So I believed them and
sold them the corpses.

561
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:45,408
I found out later what they
were going to do with them.

562
01:05:46,242 --> 01:05:48,444
That they would disguise them...

563
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:54,750
…and leave them on the mountains
as if they would have died in combat.

564
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:59,855
I kept silence until they were
declared as "false positives".

565
01:06:27,983 --> 01:06:31,854
<i>In a similar way to what happened with</i>
the photographs of February 10th

566
01:06:31,887 --> 01:06:35,624
<i>what would be properly considered as</i>
the first film made in Colombia

567
01:06:35,725 --> 01:06:40,796
<i>was also born from the intention to represent</i>
the attempt and death of a political leader.

568
01:06:41,731 --> 01:06:46,369
<i>On October 15th, 1914, a few</i>
blocks from the Capitol

569
01:06:46,469 --> 01:06:48,971
<i>the popular military</i>
hero Rafael Uribe Uribe

570
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:52,441
<i>received a mortal blow with an ax</i>
on the right side of his head.

571
01:06:53,209 --> 01:06:56,846
<i>The politician was immediately transferred</i>
to a house in the center of the city

572
01:06:56,946 --> 01:06:59,648
<i>where he agonized for </i>
14 hours and finally died.

573
01:07:03,552 --> 01:07:08,457
<i>It’s told that hundreds of his followers</i>
walked all the way back to the Capitol

574
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:10,760
<i>and with a white handkerchief </i>
in their hands

575
01:07:10,793 --> 01:07:13,462
<i>tried to pick up of the ground</i>
the blood of the politician.

576
01:07:14,296 --> 01:07:18,234
<i>That same afternoon, while</i>
Rafael Uribe Uribe still lived

577
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:23,639
<i>a few meters from the house where he was,</i>
the Italian brothers Di Doménico

578
01:07:23,939 --> 01:07:27,810
<i>who later would be recognized as</i>
"the fathers of Colombian Cinema"

579
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:32,815
<i>began with urgency the filming of the</i>
first film of the country, entitled:

580
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:36,786
<i>"The drama of October 15th",</i>
in which this murder was recreated.

581
01:07:37,686 --> 01:07:40,589
<i>Only one shot from the</i>
film is preserved.

582
01:07:40,623 --> 01:07:45,494
<i>These images are from the same</i>
date but made with other cameras.

583
01:07:45,828 --> 01:07:49,365
<i>However, due to the great</i>
controversy caused by the film

584
01:07:49,432 --> 01:07:53,702
<i>extensive descriptions of their images</i>
can be found in newspapers of the time.

585
01:07:58,274 --> 01:08:01,911
<i>For example, we know that the</i>
film started with a fade

586
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:05,247
<i>that slowly showed a</i>
portrait of the soldier.

587
01:08:05,448 --> 01:08:09,318
<i>After almost a minute in which the</i>
image was still on the screen

588
01:08:09,552 --> 01:08:14,657
<i>followed a scene that recreated the last</i>
moments of agony and death of the politician.

589
01:08:14,824 --> 01:08:18,828
<i>We also know that the film</i>
could never be fully projected.

590
01:08:19,028 --> 01:08:21,864
<i>Despite the good intentions</i>
of the Di Doménico brothers,

591
01:08:21,897 --> 01:08:24,800
<i>the audience couldn't bear to see</i>
the images of the hero dying

592
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:27,269
<i>nor could they bare seeing his assassins.</i>

593
01:08:28,337 --> 01:08:30,940
<i>The public opinion</i>
reacted radically

594
01:08:31,006 --> 01:08:33,976
<i>and pursued with the censorship</i>
and destruction of the film.

595
01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:36,412
<i>In their defense, the Italians,</i>

596
01:08:36,445 --> 01:08:40,015
<i>who due to the public harassment</i>
could never make a film again

597
01:08:40,115 --> 01:08:44,653
<i>argued in their favor referring to the</i>
images of Christ dying on the cross.

598
01:08:44,854 --> 01:08:50,192
<i>If the highest institutions such as museums</i>
and churches in all regions of the planet

599
01:08:50,392 --> 01:08:55,664
<i>allocate entire pavilions with the sole function</i>
of protecting the image of Christ dying

600
01:08:55,764 --> 01:08:58,968
<i>it is because Christ reincarnates</i>
in each one of those images.

601
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:01,537
<i>To adore those images</i>
is to adore the Christ,

602
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:04,673
<i>those images create the</i>
world of Christianity.

603
01:09:07,042 --> 01:09:10,012
<i>Thus, the Italians thought</i>

604
01:09:10,012 --> 01:09:13,382
<i>that a State is also the</i>
sum of all its images.

605
01:09:13,449 --> 01:09:17,953
<i>For the Di Doménico brothers, destroying</i>
the images of Rafael Uribe Uribe dying

606
01:09:18,087 --> 01:09:22,158
<i>was opting for a country incapable of</i>
imagining and thinking about their dead.

607
01:09:25,294 --> 01:09:29,798
<i>The first film of the Colombian Cinema,</i>
is born, and dies from this event.

608
01:09:30,432 --> 01:09:33,402
<i>This is its only remaining image</i>

609
01:09:33,469 --> 01:09:37,139
<i>the famous image of the woman</i>
holding the patriotic symbols.

610
01:09:39,041 --> 01:09:41,577
<i>I imagine the death</i>
of Rafael Uribe Uribe

611
01:09:41,644 --> 01:09:45,548
<i>with a coffin that crosses the streets, </i>
marking the path of a crowd.

612
01:09:45,948 --> 01:09:48,617
<i>The image of the people that</i>
accompanies their leader.

613
01:09:48,817 --> 01:09:51,954
<i>Perhaps this film by the</i>
Di Doménico brothers

614
01:09:52,054 --> 01:09:56,225
<i>and the events that surrounded it, </i>
allow us to see from a new perspective,

615
01:09:56,292 --> 01:09:59,929
<i>the images made by Rafael Reyes </i>
and Thomas Alva Edison.

616
01:10:00,195 --> 01:10:03,332
<i>A perspective that does not focus</i>
on the truth of the images,

617
01:10:03,399 --> 01:10:06,268
<i>but on the reaction that </i>
the public has before them.

618
01:10:06,669 --> 01:10:11,507
<i>These events highlight that the staging</i>
of death has a relative value.

619
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:15,878
<i>Rafael Reyes and Thomas Edison</i>
staged the death of rebels.

620
01:10:16,045 --> 01:10:19,148
<i>These images are celebrated</i>
and widely broadcasted.

621
01:10:19,248 --> 01:10:20,382
<i>On the contrary,</i>

622
01:10:20,382 --> 01:10:23,852
<i>the Di Doménico brothers recreated </i>
the death of a beloved political leader

623
01:10:23,919 --> 01:10:28,457
<i>and hurt the sensitivity of the national</i>
public, the images were destroyed.

624
01:10:28,624 --> 01:10:32,294
<i>This shows that the images</i>
collect a sensitivity.

625
01:10:32,428 --> 01:10:34,830
<i>A sensitivity that</i>
only becomes tolerable

626
01:10:34,863 --> 01:10:38,300
<i>when it reflects the image that a</i>
country likes to receive from itself.

627
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:41,804
<i>These events also reveal</i>
something even simpler:

628
01:10:41,804 --> 01:10:45,341
<i>the survival of certain</i>
images leads to sympathy

629
01:10:45,441 --> 01:10:48,510
<i>and intensifies the idea that there</i>
are deaths worthy of mourning

630
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:50,179
<i>and others that are not.</i>

631
01:12:37,386 --> 01:12:38,887
<i>When I look at my</i>
mother from a distance,

632
01:12:38,887 --> 01:12:42,891
<i>I feel that at any moment she will say </i>
something and her expression will change.

633
01:12:43,826 --> 01:12:46,795
<i>Maybe all I have to do is wait.</i>

634
01:12:47,096 --> 01:12:49,264
<i>I have decided that I must</i>
believe in her muteness.

635
01:12:49,331 --> 01:12:52,000
<i>I can’t not do it,</i>
when I see her images.

636
01:12:53,202 --> 01:12:55,537
<i>I think that I've been looking </i>
in the wrong places

637
01:12:55,571 --> 01:12:58,440
<i>and the reasons for her muteness </i>
are somewhere else.

638
01:15:24,953 --> 01:15:29,591
<i>Together with Carlos Pelbet, we recreated the</i>
work of a group of forensic anthropologists.

639
01:15:31,393 --> 01:15:34,296
<i>Some years ago in Colombia, </i>
they had started

640
01:15:34,296 --> 01:15:39,268
<i>the search and identification of the bodies</i>
of people missing during the war.

641
01:15:39,434 --> 01:15:43,338
<i>Exhumation units</i>
throughout the national territory

642
01:15:43,405 --> 01:15:48,176
<i>were in search of the deaths who were hidden </i>
underground by the different armies.

643
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:54,249
<i>Together with some neighbors and friends who</i>
disguised themselves as forensic and military

644
01:15:54,249 --> 01:15:57,019
<i>we walked around some</i>
fields around the village

645
01:15:57,119 --> 01:16:00,622
<i>dug graves and did a</i>
small performance

646
01:16:00,622 --> 01:16:03,292
<i>of the search for the bodies</i>
of those missing persons.

647
01:16:05,794 --> 01:16:08,730
<i>No matter how hard I try</i>

648
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:10,899
<i>I can't make myself</i>
more than a small idea

649
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:14,136
<i>of the dimension and cruelty that</i>
the "false positives" meant.

650
01:16:18,941 --> 01:16:22,844
<i>I wonder if, with the purpose</i>
of telling about these crimes

651
01:16:22,844 --> 01:16:27,549
<i>the best way wouldn’t have been through</i>
images invoking the real victims

652
01:16:27,649 --> 01:16:32,788
<i>the bodies of the executed youths, the</i>
testimonies of the relatives, the witnesses

653
01:16:32,921 --> 01:16:35,557
<i>and the people who actually</i>
suffered it in life.

654
01:16:35,624 --> 01:16:39,561
<i>However, I suspect that the same </i>
thing would happened

655
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:43,365
<i>as it did, when they were first broadcasted </i>
in television across the country.

656
01:16:43,498 --> 01:16:47,536
<i>We would simply close our eyes</i>
to avoid feeling those deaths.

657
01:16:51,139 --> 01:16:55,410
<i>When the "false positives" were presented</i>
as victories of the National Army

658
01:16:55,477 --> 01:16:58,146
<i>they were celebrated and widespread deaths.</i>

659
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:01,783
<i>But when those same dead people were</i>
stripped of their insurgent disguise

660
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:04,086
<i>and turned into state crimes</i>

661
01:17:04,152 --> 01:17:06,855
<i>they didn't become a scandalous image.</i>

662
01:17:06,888 --> 01:17:11,893
<i>There was something about the theater they</i>
represented, that the audience clung to.

663
01:17:12,861 --> 01:17:16,164
<i>Perhaps, this is what the</i>
"false positives" warn us from.

664
01:17:16,198 --> 01:17:19,801
<i>That much of the way we feel about</i>
the deaths of the war in the country

665
01:17:19,835 --> 01:17:23,138
<i>is build upon the field of</i>
appearances and images.

666
01:17:24,406 --> 01:17:27,376
<i>The representations that have</i>
been made of the violent events

667
01:17:27,409 --> 01:17:31,546
<i>have directed our sensitivity, making the</i>
war of the country seem tolerable for us

668
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:35,150
<i>as long as the dead ones remain the same.</i>

669
01:17:35,751 --> 01:17:38,920
<i>The images have become</i>
an instrument of war.

670
01:17:39,021 --> 01:17:42,190
<i>A war is also the history </i>
of its images.

671
01:18:02,677 --> 01:18:06,915
<i>♪ With justice and truth</i>

687
01:19:14,149 --> 01:19:16,785
<i>I found a recording made by my mother.</i>

688
01:19:18,086 --> 01:19:22,057
<i>It’s special because she doesn’t appear,</i>
instead her voice is heard.

689
01:19:24,092 --> 01:19:26,928
<i>Near the end she says my name.</i>

690
01:19:30,732 --> 01:19:34,870
<i>It’s August 9, 1996.</i>

691
01:19:37,005 --> 01:19:41,610
<i>Tomorrow is the parade of Silleteros.</i>
Don Carlos Zapata is here with us

692
01:19:43,745 --> 01:19:49,551
<i>who’s going to parade with a</i>
monumental style silleta.

693
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:55,190
<i>Don Carlos, for how long have you been </i>
participating in the parade?

694
01:19:55,190 --> 01:20:00,128
About ten years now, that I participate
in the parade of Silleteros.

695
01:20:00,896 --> 01:20:04,866
<i>And how many times have you won?</i>

696
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:09,671
I've only lost twice in ten years.

697
01:20:10,238 --> 01:20:13,074
Because I stopped competing. I've been
the winner for eight years now.

698
01:20:13,208 --> 01:20:16,845
<i>- You stopped competing?</i>
- Yes.

699
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:21,716
<i>- We wish you good luck for tomorrow.</i>
- Thank you.

700
01:20:49,644 --> 01:20:51,112
<i>Federico.</i>

701
01:20:55,417 --> 01:20:56,618
<i>Federico...</i>

702
01:20:58,153 --> 01:20:59,888
<i>Federico...</i>

703
01:21:01,256 --> 01:21:02,691
<i>Federico.</i>

704
01:21:05,227 --> 01:21:07,495
MUTE FIRE
