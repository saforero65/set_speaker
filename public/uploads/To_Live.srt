The 1940s

18
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,730
You've lost again.

19
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:59,000
Not one lucky toss all night.

20
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,140
Chalk it up.

21
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,150
How much?

22
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,660
Chunsheng.

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,840
I've run up a pile of debts lately.

24
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,840
But my calligraphy's improving.

25
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,690
Long'er, you neglect your troupe.

26
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:24,130
But not my money.
They sound like a pack of mules.

27
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,630
They're too tired. Been at it all night.

28
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,340
Why don't you have a go?
Show them what it takes.

29
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,080
Business is good, Mr. Xie.

30
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:49,020
Come often. You're always welcome.

31
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,960
Old Man Heaven

32
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,580
Don't make it so late

33
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,780
Me and my lover

34
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,220
want more time

35
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:59,350
To frolic in our great big bed

36
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,100
Long'er, you're nearly there.

37
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,800
One more night like this...

38
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:19,210
you'll have him right where you want him.

39
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,100
Sure there's no mistake?

40
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,580
Look at the records.

41
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:30,220
Master Fugui is going home. You take him.

42
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,460
Take care.

43
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,320
Take care, Master.

44
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,350
Welcome home, sir.

45
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,620
Dad!

46
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,660
Degenerate! Another night gambling!

47
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,030
A dog's gotta eat shit! Little bastard!

48
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,500
If you don't stop...

49
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:26,840
we'll lose the little we have.

50
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:30,040
Aren't you capable of anything else?

51
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,410
Is gambling all you know?

52
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,490
Of all you could have learned, bastard!

53
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,950
Little bastards from big bastards grow.

54
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,520
I learned all I know from you.

55
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:49,360
How do you think we lost
most of what we had in the first place?

56
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:54,530
You're the one they call big bastard, Xu,
not me!

57
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,110
Will you cut it out?

58
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:04,450
- What'd he just say?
- Nothing. Eat.

59
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:07,940
Mother, when you finish,
send him to his room.

60
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,750
Grandpa's cursing you again.

61
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,180
He's just singing to himself.

62
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,320
You're up.

63
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,970
What's wrong?

64
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,370
Don't cry.

65
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,770
It's not good for the baby.

66
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:40,150
You said you wouldn't gamble
if I got pregnant.

67
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,720
Who was gambling? I went to watch.

68
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,390
What are you crying for?

69
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,490
If nothing else, can't you think of the baby?

70
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,130
Let me wipe your tears.

71
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:55,900
I'm not your father. I can't be fooled.

72
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:59,460
All right, do it yourself. But please don't cry.

73
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,730
Fugui...

74
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,880
I've said all there is to say.

75
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,010
Can't you listen just this once?
Quit gambling.

76
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,110
It's like kicking an opium habit, you know.

77
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:18,120
Too fast, and boing, you snap!
Could kill you.

78
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,820
Can't rush these things.

79
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,090
Fengxia's growing up. Another's on the way.

80
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,460
Please.

81
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,690
I'm not asking much.

82
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:32,470
Only to live a quiet life together.

83
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,700
Fugui, you choose. Gambling or family?

84
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,510
Tell me.

85
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,760
Your win, Master Fugui.

86
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,660
My luck's changed.

87
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,400
Write that down. Another round.

88
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,080
Master Fugui, your wife's here.

89
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:31,060
What are you doing here?

90
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,250
Well?

91
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:48,870
Mr. Long'er says
if you're busy he'll take a rain check.

92
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:51,570
No, have him wait. I'll be right there.

93
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,780
This is the last time, okay? I promise.

94
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,480
Go home, go.

95
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,590
It's settled.

96
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:03,790
Mr. Xie...

97
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,530
get a rickshaw to take my wife home. I'm...

98
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,390
Of course.

99
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,910
Master Fugui, you lost.

100
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,590
Let's roll!

101
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,990
Master Fugui.

102
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,740
Come, give Mrs. Xu a seat.

103
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,980
Fugui, for the last time.

104
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:58,920
Come home.

105
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,880
Why don't you go home?
There'll be other times.

106
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,450
Your wife is right here.

107
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,560
What's with you?
Can't take "no" for an answer?

108
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,360
You want to make me lose face? Go away!

109
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,330
Get out!

110
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,870
I've just...

111
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,240
Let's play!

112
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,370
Don't worry about her.

113
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,580
Get out of my sight!

114
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,850
Go!

115
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,720
Let's roll!

116
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:49,650
Well?

117
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:54,360
Master Fugui, you're out of the game.

118
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:57,690
You've lost everything.

119
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,430
What do you mean?

120
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,200
You bet your property.
It's equal to what you owe Long'er.

121
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:09,110
You don't have a roof tile to your name.

122
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,090
What is it?

123
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,620
Master Fugui must settle his account.

124
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,150
It's all in order, I'll be going.

125
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,380
Master Fugui, don't think badly of me...

126
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,950
for leaving you homeless.

127
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,590
But I sure like that mansion of yours.

128
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,230
See you there in a few days.

129
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,670
You can't just win and walk away.

130
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,330
The game's not over yet!

131
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,710
Master Fugui, I'm sorry...

132
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:15,770
but you've nothing left.
What would you wager?

133
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,810
If you're unhappy, talk to Mr. Xie.

134
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,650
This can't be happening!

135
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,950
What are you doing?

136
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,110
It's not over yet!

137
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,190
Sit down.

138
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:33,920
- Sit down!
- You planned all this, didn't you?

139
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:43,000
- Sit.
- Just one more round!

140
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:47,770
I am very sorry, but you've got nothing left.

141
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:51,780
What could you stake the bet on?
We don't accept empty bets.

142
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,340
I'll stake my life.

143
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,480
Don't talk like that.

144
00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:00,220
Anyway, your life's worth little now.

145
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,120
Not that we'd accept it as ante.

146
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:06,530
We'll formalize the transfer in a few days...

147
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,290
and explain to your old man.

148
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,200
Just settle everything, okay?

149
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:14,400
We'll settle everything then.

150
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,930
Okay?

151
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,650
Your wife's been waiting for ages.

152
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,620
Fugui...

153
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,960
I just wanted to tell you...

154
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:45,360
I've realized...

155
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,340
you'll never change. I can't live like this.

156
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,600
I'm taking Fengxia with me.

157
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:13,660
If the baby is a boy...

158
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,490
I won't let him be like you.

159
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:39,180
Master Fugui, I'll take you.

160
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,860
- What are you doing?
- Master Fugui.

161
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,710
I have nothing left.

162
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,220
63, 73, 83...

163
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:32,400
Mr. Xu, any mistakes?

164
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:37,270
No, Fugui's signature is on each one.

165
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:42,950
Long'er, is our Xu family home...

166
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:46,650
enough to settle Fugui's debt?

167
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,160
Good.

168
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:55,830
A gambling debt's a debt,
and debts must be paid.

169
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,170
Everyone's here today.

170
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,640
So let's do what must be done.

171
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,500
The Xu family home...

172
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:07,100
goes to Long'er.

173
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:10,640
And the debt is hereby settled.

174
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,450
Both sides must sign.

175
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:36,740
I thought I'd live my final days here.

176
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,250
Fugui.

177
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,380
Turtle spawn! I'll kill him!

178
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:57,390
I'll cut him into pieces! I'll clobber him!

179
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,330
I'll never forgive you!

180
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,690
I'll never forgive you!

181
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:03,360
I want him dead!

182
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,400
Sir!

183
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:36,660
It's valuable. Don't scratch it. Take it slowly.

184
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:39,790
Careful, slowly. Don't move too fast!

185
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,930
Don't break anything!

186
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,500
Your mother's not well.
Go now, for her sake.

187
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,550
I'll look after her for a few days?

188
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:00,920
Until you're set up elsewhere.

189
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,350
Want me to help you?

190
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,480
Needles and threads for sale!

191
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:36,550
Granny!

192
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,050
Jiazhen's come home.

193
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,450
Jiazhen.

194
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,550
Come look at your son.

195
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:16,990
He looks like you.

196
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,760
No, like Jiazhen.

197
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,530
What's his name?

198
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,790
"Don't Gamble."

199
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,730
He'll never gamble.

200
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:30,330
Who chose that name?

201
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,760
Me.

202
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,510
Very good, very good.

203
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:37,510
I don't gamble now. Not even in my next life.

204
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:41,450
I know. Or I wouldn't have come back.

205
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:45,450
Is his name really "Don't Gamble"?

206
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:49,620
I was just teasing Fugui. It's Youqing.

207
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,690
Youqing, excellent.

208
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:58,160
Jiazhen, it's great to have you back.

209
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:06,770
I'd heard you'd had a boy,
and were living at home.

210
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,310
But I was too ashamed to see you.

211
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,680
Let's put the past behind us...

212
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,010
and live peacefully.

213
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:18,990
I've paid the rent with mother's jewelry.

214
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:22,390
It's crowded with all of us here.

215
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:26,790
I'll tidy up tomorrow. We'll be fine.

216
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:29,460
Mother's feeling better.

217
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:32,330
Normally she doesn't even get out of bed.

218
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,570
Dad didn't give me much money...

219
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:42,280
but she needs a doctor.

220
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:45,140
We'll work something out.

221
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,640
I'll borrow money to set up a shop.

222
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:51,420
Life won't be easy.

223
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,580
Don't say that.

224
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,510
All I ask is a quiet life together.

225
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,960
A rare visitor indeed.

226
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,100
Master Fugui! It's been a year at least.

227
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:08,970
Just call me Fugui.

228
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:11,770
This old home of yours is great.

229
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,370
Warm in winter, cool in summer.

230
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,470
Great at any price.

231
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,010
I've given up the puppet troupe.

232
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,520
Have a seat.

233
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:28,990
I don't gamble anymore.
Don't want to end up like you.

234
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,960
"Don't Gamble" is my son's name.

235
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,790
You mocking me?

236
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:36,390
No, his real name's Youqing.

237
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:39,430
Jiazhen came back with him.

238
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:42,870
We almost called him "Don't Gamble."

239
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,880
I'd like to borrow money to set up a shop.

240
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:56,710
I'm not one to lend money.

241
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:03,150
I'll lend you something else. More practical.

242
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:13,930
I never had to beg
when I ran the puppet troupe.

243
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,190
Earn your money yourself.

244
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,530
Put together a troupe.

245
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:22,910
They are fabulous.

246
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:28,250
My heart is full of sorrow

247
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:46,340
It's that hateful bandit, Jiang

248
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:08,620
I'm lucky to be alive

249
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:38,670
Me and my lover want more time

250
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:43,340
To frolic on our great big bed

251
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,880
Come out!

252
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:28,290
Come on! Get a move on!

253
00:28:56,590 --> 00:29:00,590
1949: Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Army
is losing the civil war.

254
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:04,530
The Communists under Mao Zedong
are poised to take over China.

255
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,670
So we're fighting the Communists.

256
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,770
Might never go home again.

257
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:29,220
What are you looking at?

258
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:32,890
Thinking of escaping?

259
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,130
The Nationalists will shoot you.

260
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,470
Besides...

261
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:42,860
troops for both sides are everywhere.

262
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:45,570
If you don't fight the Reds,
you fight the KMT.

263
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,170
But who will look after my wife,
my kids, my old mother?

264
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,410
Forget it. Try to save your own skin.

265
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,260
As for me...

266
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:10,600
if I weren't looking for my brother,
I wouldn't be wearing this uniform.

267
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:39,860
Chunsheng, you really are mad.

268
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:43,620
I'd die happy if I could drive.

269
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:46,170
As for me...

270
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:50,570
I want to live. There's nothing like family.

271
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:55,270
One, two, three. One, two, three.

272
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,090
This case is in the way!

273
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:08,050
Whose is it? Get rid of it!

274
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:12,420
Sir, it's mine.
I've got my things in it. Let me keep it.

275
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,620
Get it out of my sight then.

276
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,730
It's just a bunch of puppets.
Get rid of them! This is war!

277
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,130
They're not mine. It's how I make my living.

278
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:56,040
What a bloodbath.

279
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,410
What's that sound?

280
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:07,550
The wounded.

281
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,940
They're freezing.

282
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,410
No one's looking after them?

283
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:14,980
No one's left.

284
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:19,120
Must be tens of thousands
of us trapped here.

285
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,760
Way to go, Chunsheng!

286
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,170
Take this.

287
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:39,300
- Where'd you get them?
- Off the corpses.

288
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,280
Which corpses?

289
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,220
The wounded who froze to death.

290
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:49,420
Put it on. We must survive.

291
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,090
Lao Quan, have a drink.

292
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:59,360
It really is booze!

293
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,730
Was it from some dead officer?

294
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:14,310
Chunsheng and I are lucky
to meet someone as nice as you.

295
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,780
You've looked after us.

296
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:19,090
We must help each other.

297
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,820
Besides, we're from the same town.

298
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,150
Lao Quan, the place is deserted.

299
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,120
I'm still dizzy from drinking!

300
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:55,380
What happened? No one's left?

301
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:00,590
They've all run off.

302
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,130
How could that be?

303
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,960
The Reds must be on the attack.

304
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:05,130
What?

305
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,340
- Shouldn't we run, too?
- Where to?

306
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,600
Home!

307
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,770
Home?

308
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,570
Wait right here.

309
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,810
Run now...

310
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:21,380
and you'll be shot.

311
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:26,550
Better to wait and become a POW.

312
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:30,020
The Reds send POWs home.

313
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,460
So, no running?

314
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:33,720
That's right.

315
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,390
You want to go home, don't run.

316
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:38,170
They won't shoot us?

317
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:41,400
Not as long as you've got your hands up.

318
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:42,530
How?

319
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,940
This will do the trick?

320
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:54,510
Don't reach for your waist!

321
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,570
Do that and you're dead.

322
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:01,650
The Reds treat POWs well.
I've been one before.

323
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:04,890
Just put those hands up.

324
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:22,940
- The attack hasn't started.
- Let's put them down.

325
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:17,060
Chunsheng!

326
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:36,840
Dying like this,
their families won't even know.

327
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:39,720
Fugui...

328
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,890
we've got to make it back alive.

329
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:46,720
And live a good life.

330
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,270
Lao Quan! They're shooting!

331
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,850
Where did you find this coat?

332
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:13,780
- On one of the wounded.
- It's a killing field.

333
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:17,820
The coat's from my brother's unit.

334
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:21,360
- What are you doing?
- They're shooting!

335
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:31,730
What's your brother look like?

336
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:33,270
Just like me.

337
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:53,020
Lao Quan!

338
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:36,420
The enemy's secret weapon

339
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:42,130
wounded me

340
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:50,600
I gather my troops

341
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:04,210
and we run for our lives

342
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:45,650
Fengxia!

343
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:01,190
It's your daddy.

344
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:08,440
What are you doing?

345
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,770
Where's mommy?

346
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:52,520
I'm home.

347
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:54,550
Home.

348
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:44,000
Mother died without knowing where I was.

349
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,010
The day...

350
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,510
we sang for the Liberation Army.

351
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,180
Suppose I was singing for her, too.

352
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,920
She never shut her eyes...

353
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:08,850
kept them fixed on the door,
so sure you'd be back.

354
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,570
You should have written.

355
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:15,260
Written?

356
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:19,000
I never thought I'd make it back alive.

357
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,170
I thought of you...

358
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:27,110
all the time and worried...

359
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,820
how you were getting by.

360
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,310
The new government
paid for mother's burial...

361
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:36,660
and gave me this job, delivering water.

362
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:38,490
I'm up before dawn.

363
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:40,930
Everyone wants water.

364
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,520
The more I deliver, the more I earn.

365
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:47,790
It's been hard on the kids.

366
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:50,200
They never get...

367
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,870
a good night's sleep.

368
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:56,070
How come Fengxia can't talk?

369
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,370
She was fine when I left.

370
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:01,680
She can't even say "Daddy."

371
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:04,450
In fact, she was lucky.

372
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:07,020
For a week, she ran a high fever.

373
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:12,260
No one thought she'd pull through.

374
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:14,850
When the fever came down...

375
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:17,060
she'd lost her voice.

376
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,460
You're here.

377
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:49,000
Fugui's back.

378
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:52,430
This is our town leader, Mr. Niu.

379
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:55,400
So you're our leading cadre.

380
00:46:56,270 --> 00:46:59,210
- I heard you got back this morning.
- I'm back.

381
00:46:59,470 --> 00:47:02,200
I have come to see if you need anything.

382
00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:04,070
Look at this.

383
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:10,120
He has served in the Liberation Army?

384
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,050
You participated in the revolution.

385
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,450
I just dragged a cannon and sang opera.

386
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,790
That's taking part.

387
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:24,290
You were with Chunsheng.
Why isn't he back?

388
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:27,560
He joined the army as a driver.
He went south with them.

389
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:30,130
We won't see him for a while.

390
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:32,740
Fugui, you're back just in time...

391
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:35,110
to attend Long'er's public trial.

392
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:38,580
Come along and get an education.

393
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:42,210
What did Long'er do?

394
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:47,450
Because of the family home,
he's been sentenced a landlord.

395
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:52,030
But it's not just that.

396
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:55,820
The government wanted part of the house.

397
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:58,700
He refused, beat up a cadre...

398
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:01,600
and then set fire to the place.

399
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,770
Classic counterrevolutionary sabotage.

400
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:09,940
He burnt it?

401
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:13,910
It burnt for days.

402
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:17,180
Your timber was first class!

403
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:22,960
That wasn't ours.
It was counterrevolutionary timber.

404
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:26,150
Counterrevolutionary timber.

405
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:30,430
Of course. You're you, he's him.

406
00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:34,800
Execute the revolutionary despot, Long'er!

407
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:39,800
To the execution ground!

408
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:43,100
We will crush the counterrevolution!

409
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:46,110
Crush the counterrevolution!

410
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:48,810
Down with the counterrevolutionaries!

411
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:55,090
Long live the Communist Party!

412
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:58,060
Long live the People's Government!

413
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:07,830
Long live Chairman Mao!
Down with the counterrevolutionaries!

414
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,330
Build a new China!

415
00:50:12,030 --> 00:50:13,500
What's wrong?

416
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,340
Why are your pants wet?

417
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,670
Five bullets. Five.

418
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:21,700
They shot him.

419
00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:23,510
They shot Long'er?

420
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:26,840
Pumped five bullets into him.

421
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:29,310
He is dead.

422
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:31,440
If I hadn't lost my home to him...

423
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,320
that'd have been me.

424
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:39,220
What class do we belong to?

425
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:41,650
Landlords?

426
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:45,830
Surely not. We lost that status to Long'er.
So, what are we?

427
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,730
Not landlords.

428
00:50:49,370 --> 00:50:51,070
Ordinary townspeople.

429
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:54,730
Sounds okay to me.
And I took part in the revolution.

430
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:09,020
- What are you looking for?
- That certificate.

431
00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:12,120
- In the wash?
- No, here it is.

432
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:16,060
Better dry it out fast.

433
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:18,700
Have to keep it safe.

434
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:24,530
Are you sure we're just townsfolk?

435
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,800
Of course.

436
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,970
Poor townspeople.

437
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:32,400
It's good to be poor. Nothing like it.

438
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,580
Get a frame for it tomorrow.

439
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:39,050
I'll hang it on the wall.

440
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:40,720
Good idea!

441
00:51:55,440 --> 00:52:00,400
The 1950s

442
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,840
1958: Mao Zedong launches
the "Great Leap Forward."

443
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:08,710
Steel production is now targeted
at 10.7 million tonnes per year.

444
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:12,310
Every household donates its iron utensils.

445
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:32,010
Take a break.

446
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:36,640
Tired?

447
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:41,280
Fugui!

448
00:52:44,590 --> 00:52:46,990
Our family's turn to donate iron.

449
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:49,050
It's ready.

450
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,410
It's all here?

451
00:52:52,390 --> 00:52:53,760
Keep these.

452
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:56,620
To deliver water to the steelworks.

453
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,430
Everyone will be thirsty.

454
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,130
We'll take these.

455
00:53:03,270 --> 00:53:06,710
If you take all our pots away,
how will we cook?

456
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:10,970
We're racing towards Communism,
and you worry about food?

457
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:14,000
We are setting up communal kitchens.

458
00:53:14,350 --> 00:53:16,280
When you're hungry...

459
00:53:16,350 --> 00:53:19,120
just come to the canteen.

460
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:21,280
There'll be meat, fish.

461
00:53:23,490 --> 00:53:25,760
Nothing else to contribute?

462
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:27,920
Yes, there is!

463
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:34,690
But that's wood.

464
00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:37,370
There's metal on it.

465
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:44,170
And here are pins.

466
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:46,070
It can't be worth much.

467
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:49,670
We are less politically aware than your son.

468
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:52,080
It's enough for two bullets.

469
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:55,850
We are just two bullets short
of liberating Taiwan.

470
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:58,030
So let's get that metal.

471
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:12,570
The workers deserve entertaining,
don't they?

472
00:54:12,810 --> 00:54:15,900
You know, I sang for the Liberation Army...

473
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,510
and after that...

474
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:21,710
they captured two mountains a day.

475
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,180
I see your point.

476
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:28,520
All I've seen at the worksites
are student marching bands.

477
00:54:29,790 --> 00:54:32,280
We'll spur them on with puppet shows.

478
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:33,950
You can leave those.

479
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:35,830
We won't touch them.

480
00:54:39,370 --> 00:54:41,490
We're off to the next house.

481
00:54:43,810 --> 00:54:46,330
We are not going to liberate Taiwan?

482
00:54:46,970 --> 00:54:50,270
Sure we are. We'll definitely liberate Taiwan.

483
00:55:53,810 --> 00:55:55,540
Take that!

484
00:56:46,190 --> 00:56:47,660
- Enough?
- No!

485
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,530
Enough?

486
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:54,690
Still not enough? Okay, I'll fill it right up.

487
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:58,270
Big ambition for a little kid.

488
00:56:59,570 --> 00:57:01,540
It's more than enough.

489
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:04,570
So gobble away. Help yourself to sauces.

490
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:13,010
Youqing, I'll help you stir that up.

491
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:15,820
What a big appetite!

492
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:19,330
And so much chili sauce!

493
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:29,900
That's a big bowl, Youqing.

494
00:57:29,970 --> 00:57:32,410
Give it to us if you can't finish.

495
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:07,630
What the hell are you doing?

496
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:09,400
How could you?

497
00:58:12,450 --> 00:58:15,010
Can't you control this child?

498
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:17,850
What did you think you were doing?

499
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,390
What is this?

500
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:23,320
Look at all the chili sauce.
Let me see your eyes.

501
00:58:25,790 --> 00:58:27,420
This is too much.

502
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:31,890
- Trying to kill him, or what?
- They're just kids.

503
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:34,460
Kids? Where did he learn that from?

504
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:39,370
This hasn't anything to do with us adults.

505
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:41,870
We don't know what's going on.

506
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:44,740
Do you expect me to believe that?

507
00:58:44,910 --> 00:58:48,180
It's sabotage.
Sabotage to the communal kitchen.

508
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:52,280
And sabotage of the Great Leap Forward!

509
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,560
That kid could not dream that up.

510
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:01,090
Youqing! Look what you've done!

511
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:04,690
Apologize. Say you were wrong.

512
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,490
Now!

513
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,530
I'm talking to you.

514
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:14,970
- Are you going?
- No.

515
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:17,270
- Are you going or not?
- No!

516
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:20,040
- I'm telling you to go!
- No!

517
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:23,280
You won't go?

518
00:59:26,790 --> 00:59:28,780
Don't hit him!

519
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:34,320
Leave him alone! I'll kill him!

520
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:35,330
Enough!

521
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:42,990
How could you?

522
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:46,300
Said he was a saboteur. I had to.

523
00:59:46,770 --> 00:59:49,470
That guy's word is law? The government?

524
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:52,240
I tried to stop you.

525
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:55,540
Why wouldn't he just apologize?

526
00:59:56,550 --> 00:59:58,580
I hit him for not obeying.

527
00:59:58,650 --> 01:00:00,020
That's no excuse.

528
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:02,140
You spoil him.

529
01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:03,710
How so?

530
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:07,130
Can't you see I'm doing this for our family?

531
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:09,090
Don't you understand?

532
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:11,490
If you indulge him, we'll all go to ruin.

533
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:13,900
I'll hit him again if I have to.

534
01:00:23,610 --> 01:00:26,100
Sit then. Right in front of me!

535
01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:30,480
Isn't he your own flesh and blood?

536
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:33,610
You, looking after us! After all these years.

537
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:36,380
What do you know?

538
01:00:37,590 --> 01:00:41,150
Kids had been bullying Fengxia.
He was defending her.

539
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,870
Do you think I'd let this family go to ruin?

540
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:51,860
I've stuck with you through good and bad.

541
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:53,840
Have I ever complained?

542
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:38,780
Poor Fengxia.
Can't even talk back to bullies.

543
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:44,420
Youqing adores her. And you'd hit him.

544
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:53,690
Daddy will make it better.

545
01:01:57,940 --> 01:01:59,910
Youqing, after dinner...

546
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:02,600
come see the show.

547
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:05,700
Youqing's not going to any stupid show.

548
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:16,910
He uses the secret mirror

549
01:02:20,390 --> 01:02:25,420
and blinds all who look within

550
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:45,210
I yell there's no time to waste

551
01:03:11,110 --> 01:03:16,140
Far away, we flee with haste

552
01:03:31,690 --> 01:03:34,710
Jiazhen, where's Youqing?

553
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:36,820
He wouldn't come.

554
01:03:37,930 --> 01:03:39,420
Ask him again.

555
01:03:39,530 --> 01:03:41,190
Say I want him to.

556
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:46,200
Youqing, daddy wants you to see the show.

557
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:53,500
Well?

558
01:03:53,810 --> 01:03:55,300
I'm not going!

559
01:03:57,450 --> 01:03:59,750
Do you like hearing daddy sing?

560
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:04,110
Mommy doesn't either. He's so smug.

561
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:09,410
Let's play a practical joke on him.

562
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:15,600
Take him tea full of vinegar.

563
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,870
That will teach him.

564
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:24,430
Enough?

565
01:04:29,380 --> 01:04:31,470
Okay, we'll really get him.

566
01:04:34,950 --> 01:04:36,710
Should we add chili?

567
01:04:38,350 --> 01:04:40,820
Good, it'll be hot and sour soup.

568
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:49,650
Your boy's on his way with a bowl of tea.

569
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:55,360
Youqing, is that tea for me?

570
01:05:55,930 --> 01:05:58,330
Good boy, bring it over here.

571
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:09,940
Daddy.

572
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:12,710
How do you like my singing?

573
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:38,270
You little bastard! I'll break your legs!

574
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:43,340
He's put in chili!

575
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:49,690
We've smelted our steel...

576
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,990
and reached our production target.

577
01:07:52,060 --> 01:07:54,500
We're off to report the good news.

578
01:07:55,230 --> 01:07:57,220
Everyone's earned merit.

579
01:07:57,670 --> 01:08:01,970
Fugui, Jiazhen,
you've made a real contribution.

580
01:08:02,610 --> 01:08:05,670
There'll be dumplings
at the canteen tonight...

581
01:08:06,310 --> 01:08:09,240
with a whole pig stuffed in each one!

582
01:08:12,050 --> 01:08:16,380
Eat your fill, and then we'll continue.

583
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:19,920
Fifteen years, we'll surpass America.

584
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:31,500
We've made enough steel
for three cannon balls.

585
01:08:31,570 --> 01:08:33,590
They'll all go to Taiwan!

586
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:37,000
One to land on Chiang Kai-shek's bed...

587
01:08:37,070 --> 01:08:39,340
another on his dinner table...

588
01:08:39,410 --> 01:08:42,400
and the last in the toilet!

589
01:08:44,450 --> 01:08:47,880
He won't be able to sleep or eat
or ever take a dump...

590
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:50,540
and we'll liberate Taiwan!

591
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:58,360
Xia, Youqing, have some dumplings.

592
01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:08,970
Let them sleep. They'll eat later.

593
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:41,000
Xu Youqing!

594
01:09:48,410 --> 01:09:49,440
What's up?

595
01:09:49,510 --> 01:09:52,450
The teacher wants us at school
smelting steel.

596
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:54,680
The District Head's making an inspection.

597
01:09:54,750 --> 01:09:56,840
All right. You go on ahead.

598
01:09:58,620 --> 01:10:00,920
Pack a lunchbox. I'll wake him.

599
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:04,920
He's not going anywhere.
He hasn't slept in days.

600
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:07,390
Leave him alone.

601
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:11,900
- The District Chief is coming.
- So?

602
01:10:12,770 --> 01:10:14,760
A kid still has to sleep.

603
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:20,040
Smelting steel is a duty.
We can't be politically backward.

604
01:10:20,110 --> 01:10:22,810
Mr. Niu praised us in front of everyone.

605
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:28,720
Youqing has to go.

606
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:35,820
Wake up.

607
01:10:36,130 --> 01:10:38,220
You have to go smelt steel.

608
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:42,390
Come on, get up.

609
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:47,160
Your classmates are already on their way.

610
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:50,570
Must not be politically backward.
You can sleep later.

611
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:54,670
Are 15 dumplings enough?

612
01:10:57,710 --> 01:11:00,240
Have 20. You should eat more.

613
01:11:12,530 --> 01:11:15,620
Youqing, wake up. We're nearly there.

614
01:11:19,270 --> 01:11:21,070
When you get there...

615
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:23,640
put your dumplings in hot water.

616
01:11:24,940 --> 01:11:27,810
Make sure you make them hot enough.

617
01:11:28,710 --> 01:11:31,310
Cold dumplings are bad for the tummy.

618
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,680
- Do you like dumplings?
- Yes.

619
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:38,310
- Do you like meat?
- Yes.

620
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:39,820
That's good.

621
01:11:40,390 --> 01:11:42,760
If Youqing does as daddy says...

622
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:45,520
our lives will get better and better.

623
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:47,660
Our family...

624
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:51,360
is like a little chicken.

625
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:54,930
When it grows up, it becomes a goose.

626
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:58,000
And that'll turn into a sheep.

627
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:01,040
The sheep will turn into an ox.

628
01:12:01,110 --> 01:12:02,540
And after the ox?

629
01:12:02,610 --> 01:12:04,640
After the ox is Communism.

630
01:12:05,310 --> 01:12:08,940
And there'll be dumplings and meat
every day.

631
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:08,670
It's Fugui's son?

632
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:11,650
District Chief arrived after dark.

633
01:13:11,710 --> 01:13:16,080
He backed up,
and his jeep knocked the wall down.

634
01:13:16,150 --> 01:13:19,020
Youqing was sleeping on the other side.

635
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:21,850
When the wall collapsed...

636
01:13:22,330 --> 01:13:24,160
he didn't have a chance.

637
01:13:24,230 --> 01:13:26,560
The District Chief was hurt, too.

638
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:30,130
He hadn't slept for three days.

639
01:13:56,730 --> 01:13:58,420
Fugui, listen to me.

640
01:13:58,490 --> 01:14:02,430
We have to try and bear it,
even in the worst of times.

641
01:14:18,850 --> 01:14:20,440
What's happened?

642
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:23,350
Answer me!

643
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:29,460
Daddy's here! Say something!

644
01:14:42,570 --> 01:14:44,540
Take the body away!

645
01:14:45,370 --> 01:14:47,570
We mustn't let his mother see.

646
01:14:55,820 --> 01:14:58,220
Mommy's here! Youqing!

647
01:15:00,490 --> 01:15:02,510
Youqing! What's going on?

648
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:08,920
Let me see him!

649
01:16:27,780 --> 01:16:31,680
You never had the chance to eat
the dumplings I packed for you.

650
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:35,450
Mommy's made you more...

651
01:16:37,820 --> 01:16:39,450
twenty this time.

652
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:42,880
That should be enough.

653
01:16:44,530 --> 01:16:46,290
Once you've eaten...

654
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:48,490
you can sleep...

655
01:16:49,870 --> 01:16:51,590
a nice, deep sleep.

656
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:55,740
In life, you never had a good night's sleep.

657
01:17:00,780 --> 01:17:02,640
So sleep well now.

658
01:17:05,780 --> 01:17:08,220
Mommy will come see you every day.

659
01:17:15,090 --> 01:17:17,650
Youqing, can you ever forgive me?

660
01:17:20,660 --> 01:17:23,290
I shouldn't have let you go to school.

661
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:27,430
I should've kept your dad...

662
01:17:27,870 --> 01:17:29,600
from making you go.

663
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:37,110
It's all my fault.

664
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:43,680
If only I'd stopped him.

665
01:17:46,090 --> 01:17:48,720
I shouldn't have let you go, Youqing!

666
01:17:51,490 --> 01:17:53,430
Oh, my poor darling.

667
01:18:16,090 --> 01:18:18,210
The District Chief has come.

668
01:18:27,860 --> 01:18:29,990
The one who ran over my son?

669
01:18:30,730 --> 01:18:32,530
What's he doing here?

670
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:36,860
Tell him to leave. He killed my son.

671
01:18:36,940 --> 01:18:39,670
- He's already here.
- Tell him to go.

672
01:18:49,890 --> 01:18:51,610
It's me, Chunsheng.

673
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:01,160
I meant to call...

674
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:03,930
after I settled in.

675
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:07,930
Fugui...

676
01:19:09,710 --> 01:19:11,700
how could it be your son?

677
01:19:15,010 --> 01:19:17,040
You're the District Chief?

678
01:19:18,610 --> 01:19:20,810
It was you who killed my son?

679
01:19:25,890 --> 01:19:28,520
I had only one son, Chunsheng!

680
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:31,690
I had only one son!

681
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:36,730
And you killed him!

682
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:42,000
You, behind the goddamn wheel!

683
01:19:45,870 --> 01:19:47,600
Don't be like that.

684
01:19:47,910 --> 01:19:50,240
The District Chief is upset, too.

685
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:56,780
How can I ever make it up?

686
01:19:57,550 --> 01:19:59,490
Take this for now.

687
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:03,520
It's money.

688
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:07,520
Tell me what else I can do.

689
01:20:09,730 --> 01:20:11,320
No one wants your money.

690
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:13,890
I want my son. Give me back my son.

691
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:18,100
You killed him! Give him back to me!

692
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:21,970
Go away!

693
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:25,640
Remember, you owe us a life.

694
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:29,380
You killed him. Remember that.

695
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,480
You killed him.

696
01:20:33,220 --> 01:20:35,320
Go away! Now!

697
01:20:36,290 --> 01:20:37,780
District Chief, let's go.

698
01:20:37,860 --> 01:20:40,920
I think you should go, Chief.

699
01:20:43,330 --> 01:20:44,560
Go away!

700
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:53,440
All right.

701
01:20:54,010 --> 01:20:55,340
I'm going.

702
01:20:56,910 --> 01:20:58,540
I owe you a life.

703
01:21:01,150 --> 01:21:02,740
I will remember.

704
01:21:12,090 --> 01:21:16,000
What are you doing, you little wretch?
I'll teach you a lesson!

705
01:21:16,370 --> 01:21:19,130
What are you doing?

706
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,070
How dare you!

707
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:22,690
What's going on?

708
01:21:22,810 --> 01:21:25,900
She smashed the windows of the jeep.

709
01:21:26,710 --> 01:21:28,470
Who the heck is she?

710
01:21:29,310 --> 01:21:31,280
Let her go!

711
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:33,680
Are you mad?

712
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:37,580
Do you want your jeep?

713
01:21:38,220 --> 01:21:39,210
No!

714
01:22:01,780 --> 01:22:07,440
The 1960s

715
01:22:12,390 --> 01:22:15,620
June 1966: Start of the
"Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

716
01:22:15,690 --> 01:22:17,960
It lasted 10 years...

717
01:22:18,030 --> 01:22:20,960
and left no family unaffected.

718
01:22:38,150 --> 01:22:40,710
- You're eating?
- Come on in, Mr. Niu.

719
01:22:40,780 --> 01:22:43,880
- Don't let me interrupt.
- We're finished.

720
01:22:44,620 --> 01:22:46,140
Sit here.

721
01:22:56,270 --> 01:22:59,460
You have to get rid of those puppets.

722
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,670
Everyone knows about them.

723
01:23:05,510 --> 01:23:07,100
I was telling Jiazhen...

724
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:09,700
that we could...

725
01:23:10,550 --> 01:23:11,980
do propaganda shows.

726
01:23:12,050 --> 01:23:14,380
Put these old things to new use.

727
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:17,620
Don't you see what they are?

728
01:23:19,220 --> 01:23:21,590
Emperors, scholars and beauties.

729
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,550
Classic feudal types.

730
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:28,120
Latest editorial:

731
01:23:28,330 --> 01:23:30,760
"The older, the more reactionary."

732
01:23:39,780 --> 01:23:41,740
Do as Chairman Mao says.

733
01:23:56,330 --> 01:23:59,020
They always remind Jiazhen of Youqing.

734
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:05,500
Let's not bring up the past.

735
01:24:09,940 --> 01:24:12,930
Burn them, okay?
I've got other people to see.

736
01:24:20,250 --> 01:24:21,880
Fetch a brazier.

737
01:24:25,050 --> 01:24:27,350
You can't keep them. Burn them!

738
01:24:51,380 --> 01:24:52,610
Fugui...

739
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:56,010
Chunsheng has asked me many times...

740
01:24:56,220 --> 01:24:59,120
to get you a better job. What do you think?

741
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:02,150
Delivering water is fine.

742
01:25:02,220 --> 01:25:06,290
Jiazhen's health is poor.
If we're together, I can look after her.

743
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:08,460
We'll discuss it later.

744
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,730
I may have found a prospect for Fengxia.

745
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:16,390
I'll tell you about him.

746
01:25:16,470 --> 01:25:19,100
Let's not let her in on it for now.

747
01:25:24,310 --> 01:25:26,650
I've found just the man for her.

748
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:30,910
His name is Wan Erxi.

749
01:25:31,950 --> 01:25:34,750
He works in a factory in the county seat.

750
01:25:35,890 --> 01:25:38,920
He is the leader of the factory's Red Guards.

751
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:41,790
He'd like to meet her.

752
01:25:41,860 --> 01:25:44,590
Sounds too good. Will he go for Fengxia?

753
01:25:45,230 --> 01:25:47,330
He's also got a handicap...

754
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:49,170
a lame leg.

755
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:52,330
How lame? Can he walk?

756
01:25:52,710 --> 01:25:55,300
Yes, and run if he has to.

757
01:25:56,750 --> 01:25:58,110
He can run?

758
01:25:59,110 --> 01:26:00,950
Was he born a cripple?

759
01:26:01,020 --> 01:26:03,310
No, it was an accident at work.

760
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:05,980
He gets compensation.

761
01:26:08,890 --> 01:26:12,490
Shall we invite him over?
Fengxia can check him out.

762
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:20,030
Does she mind us playing matchmaker?

763
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:24,900
She's not opposed,
she does fret about leaving us.

764
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:34,450
Comrade Wan Erxi's here.

765
01:26:39,790 --> 01:26:41,420
Comrade Wan Erxi.

766
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:43,990
Fengxia's mom and dad.

767
01:26:44,860 --> 01:26:46,350
Come inside.

768
01:26:57,170 --> 01:26:59,140
Have something to drink.

769
01:27:03,580 --> 01:27:05,770
Quotations from Chairman Mao

770
01:27:08,350 --> 01:27:11,290
Comrade Wan works
at the East Wind Factory.

771
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:14,690
His father and grandfather
were workers, too.

772
01:27:14,990 --> 01:27:17,020
Solid working class stock.

773
01:27:18,890 --> 01:27:21,890
Fengxia's father took part in the revolution.

774
01:27:22,030 --> 01:27:23,520
A good family.

775
01:27:24,170 --> 01:27:27,100
The Liberation Army
gave me that certificate.

776
01:27:37,810 --> 01:27:38,910
Good.

777
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:48,510
Where's Fengxia?

778
01:27:58,970 --> 01:28:00,870
Comrade Wan Erxi.

779
01:28:01,700 --> 01:28:03,300
Comrade Fengxia.

780
01:28:19,590 --> 01:28:20,920
I'll be going.

781
01:28:20,990 --> 01:28:23,220
Have something to eat first. Lunch is ready.

782
01:28:23,290 --> 01:28:24,660
No, thanks.

783
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,520
You won't stay?

784
01:28:29,700 --> 01:28:31,030
Have some lunch first.

785
01:28:31,100 --> 01:28:32,730
No, really.

786
01:28:35,700 --> 01:28:36,690
Let's go.

787
01:28:51,020 --> 01:28:52,420
What do you think?

788
01:28:52,490 --> 01:28:55,220
His leg's not so bad, and he seems nice.

789
01:28:55,860 --> 01:28:57,190
I approve.

790
01:28:57,530 --> 01:29:00,020
Who's to say he'll like our Fengxia?

791
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:03,760
He only glanced at her, and wouldn't stay.

792
01:29:04,230 --> 01:29:06,430
If it doesn't work out, we'll keep looking.

793
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:08,660
Anyway, it's up to Fengxia.

794
01:29:18,380 --> 01:29:20,250
I think she likes him.

795
01:29:20,380 --> 01:29:22,780
It's different from before. Look.

796
01:29:36,630 --> 01:29:38,460
Go ask Mr. Niu...

797
01:29:39,530 --> 01:29:41,300
what the boy thinks.

798
01:29:54,380 --> 01:29:56,370
How's this for Fengxia?

799
01:29:58,490 --> 01:30:00,890
Comrade, could I look at that one?

800
01:30:02,990 --> 01:30:04,620
There's trouble at your home.

801
01:30:04,690 --> 01:30:07,390
Red Guards are swarming over the place.

802
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:11,300
I just caught them on a ladder,
pulling off roof tiles.

803
01:30:11,530 --> 01:30:12,900
From where?

804
01:30:12,970 --> 01:30:16,300
No idea! The leader is a cripple.

805
01:30:16,610 --> 01:30:18,160
You'd better hurry back.

806
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:19,570
A cripple?

807
01:30:19,910 --> 01:30:21,540
Must be Wan Erxi!

808
01:30:22,010 --> 01:30:25,310
He doesn't like Fengxia,
so he tears the place down.

809
01:30:25,410 --> 01:30:27,040
Anything is possible.

810
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:29,410
Mr. Niu said he was a Red Guard.

811
01:30:31,350 --> 01:30:33,080
We'd better hurry.

812
01:30:33,150 --> 01:30:35,180
Don't forget your package!

813
01:31:06,490 --> 01:31:08,080
Aren't you busy!

814
01:31:08,660 --> 01:31:10,680
I brought some colleagues.

815
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:12,780
We're fixing the place up.

816
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:15,960
We replaced the roof tiles...

817
01:31:16,030 --> 01:31:18,160
so it wouldn't leak anymore.

818
01:31:18,530 --> 01:31:21,370
And we've painted Chairman Mao's portrait.

819
01:31:23,610 --> 01:31:25,270
Fengxia helped us.

820
01:31:29,710 --> 01:31:32,510
You're just in time. We've just finished.

821
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:36,010
- Don't rush off!
- I'll make you something to eat.

822
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:38,450
We must be going.

823
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:42,920
Do stay! Come on inside.

824
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:46,850
Erxi painted this.

825
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:51,600
"The working class leads us all."

826
01:31:51,670 --> 01:31:53,660
Erxi is good with his hands.

827
01:31:53,740 --> 01:31:56,930
He painted all the Chairman Maos
in our factory!

828
01:31:59,470 --> 01:32:01,910
I'll get some water so you can wash up.

829
01:32:01,980 --> 01:32:04,810
Thanks, we'll go to the factory bathhouse.

830
01:32:10,620 --> 01:32:12,920
You've gone to so much trouble.

831
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:14,780
Please come again.

832
01:32:22,360 --> 01:32:25,490
What do you think about Fengxia and me?

833
01:32:26,370 --> 01:32:28,340
We're happy if you are.

834
01:32:28,570 --> 01:32:29,940
We approve.

835
01:32:30,270 --> 01:32:32,830
Shall we set a date?

836
01:32:34,180 --> 01:32:35,940
Anytime. You decide.

837
01:32:37,710 --> 01:32:40,340
Fengxia's had a hard life.

838
01:32:41,350 --> 01:32:43,110
If you don't mind...

839
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:46,010
let's make the wedding a real occasion.

840
01:32:46,250 --> 01:32:47,920
To make her happy.

841
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:46,400
Today comrades, Wan Erxi and Xu Fengxia...

842
01:33:46,820 --> 01:33:48,780
begin their wedded life.

843
01:33:49,350 --> 01:33:52,720
In good times, we think of Chairman Mao.

844
01:33:53,150 --> 01:33:54,820
Let's sing a song!

845
01:34:00,900 --> 01:34:05,660
Nothing compares
to the Party's benevolence

846
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:12,230
Chairman Mao is dearer
than father and mother

847
01:34:13,070 --> 01:34:18,740
There's nothing as good as socialism

848
01:34:19,050 --> 01:34:24,610
No ocean as deep as class feeling

849
01:34:25,020 --> 01:34:28,680
Maoist Thought
is revolution's treasure trove

850
01:34:28,790 --> 01:34:34,630
Whoever opposes it, we take as our enemy

851
01:34:53,750 --> 01:34:56,220
Come on, you can't cry today.

852
01:34:57,890 --> 01:35:00,320
They're all singing for Fengxia...

853
01:35:01,390 --> 01:35:03,480
and she can't even join in!

854
01:35:03,590 --> 01:35:06,420
At least it's loud enough for her to hear.

855
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:12,230
Time for a photo!

856
01:35:18,870 --> 01:35:20,840
Move aside! Stand still!

857
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:27,370
Hold your little Red Books.

858
01:35:30,690 --> 01:35:33,180
Clear a path! Ship sailing through!

859
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:40,250
Let's get the whole family.

860
01:35:51,570 --> 01:35:55,980
The ship of revolution! Advance
through the storm with Chairman Mao!

861
01:36:01,180 --> 01:36:02,770
Time to wrap up.

862
01:36:03,050 --> 01:36:05,580
First, pay respects to Chairman Mao.

863
01:36:16,430 --> 01:36:17,990
Chairman Mao...

864
01:36:18,870 --> 01:36:21,600
Comrade Fengxia's mine now.

865
01:36:27,910 --> 01:36:30,140
Come over here.

866
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:32,750
Now, bow!

867
01:36:35,120 --> 01:36:36,480
Dad, Mom...

868
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:38,410
I'm taking Fengxia.

869
01:36:38,690 --> 01:36:40,650
I'll look after her.

870
01:37:10,750 --> 01:37:12,220
Go on, don't be sad.

871
01:37:12,850 --> 01:37:14,790
You'll be back!

872
01:37:39,850 --> 01:37:41,110
Chunsheng.

873
01:37:43,580 --> 01:37:45,880
Congratulations on Fengxia's wedding.

874
01:37:46,290 --> 01:37:48,760
- When did you get here?
- A while ago.

875
01:37:49,090 --> 01:37:52,150
But there were so many people,
I didn't come in.

876
01:37:56,860 --> 01:37:58,390
Come on inside.

877
01:37:58,470 --> 01:38:00,370
Jiazhen, make some tea.

878
01:38:10,610 --> 01:38:12,580
Isn't the tea ready yet?

879
01:38:12,710 --> 01:38:14,840
Chunsheng's been here for ages.

880
01:38:14,920 --> 01:38:16,650
Water's not boiled.

881
01:38:17,320 --> 01:38:19,180
Sit with us for a bit.

882
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:21,480
Don't be like that.

883
01:38:24,830 --> 01:38:27,260
Come as soon as the water's ready.

884
01:38:31,700 --> 01:38:33,670
But here's boiled water.

885
01:38:36,570 --> 01:38:39,060
Chunsheng came to wish Fengxia well.

886
01:38:39,140 --> 01:38:41,340
You can't go on avoiding him.

887
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:46,610
Can't we put this behind us?

888
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:51,350
If only Youqing had been here today.

889
01:39:01,430 --> 01:39:03,260
I'll be going.

890
01:39:03,870 --> 01:39:05,830
Don't go. The tea's ready.

891
01:39:05,900 --> 01:39:07,270
Never mind.

892
01:39:09,940 --> 01:39:12,740
Jiazhen, I know you don't want to see me.

893
01:39:13,170 --> 01:39:15,800
I'll leave my gift here and be gone.

894
01:39:34,360 --> 01:39:36,130
Give it back to him.

895
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:38,630
I don't want his gifts.

896
01:39:38,730 --> 01:39:40,700
But it's Chairman Mao.

897
01:40:04,690 --> 01:40:06,280
Dad! Mom!

898
01:40:13,100 --> 01:40:14,470
Come on in!

899
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:18,400
Fengxia, you're back!

900
01:40:19,070 --> 01:40:20,340
You cold?

901
01:40:25,910 --> 01:40:27,240
I'm fine, really.

902
01:40:27,320 --> 01:40:29,720
How are you feeling, Mom?

903
01:40:29,780 --> 01:40:30,770
On the mend.

904
01:40:30,850 --> 01:40:32,880
Better when you come over.

905
01:40:33,990 --> 01:40:35,510
Have you eaten?

906
01:40:35,890 --> 01:40:37,410
I'll make something.

907
01:40:37,490 --> 01:40:40,220
Lunch is all taken care of.

908
01:40:48,200 --> 01:40:50,100
Help me with the table.

909
01:40:59,110 --> 01:41:01,510
You brought a bottle.

910
01:41:14,900 --> 01:41:17,660
Dad, Mom, we're having a baby.

911
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:21,490
No wonder there's a bottle!

912
01:41:22,140 --> 01:41:23,330
Really?

913
01:41:23,940 --> 01:41:28,000
I just came from the hospital.
The doctor says it's due in autumn.

914
01:41:29,940 --> 01:41:32,240
Fengxia's going to be a mother.

915
01:41:33,180 --> 01:41:35,770
Fengxia, you're going to be a mother.

916
01:41:37,490 --> 01:41:38,680
Cheers!

917
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:48,460
Erxi, when you went to the hospital today...

918
01:41:48,760 --> 01:41:51,560
what did they say about Fengxia's health?

919
01:41:51,700 --> 01:41:53,890
That she's in terrific shape.

920
01:41:55,100 --> 01:41:57,000
Still, you can't be too careful.

921
01:41:57,070 --> 01:41:58,830
Your folks aren't around.

922
01:41:58,910 --> 01:42:02,070
After the birth,
you'll stay with us for a while.

923
01:42:04,910 --> 01:42:07,610
Spend as much time as you can with her.

924
01:42:08,820 --> 01:42:11,150
When I was pregnant with Fengxia...

925
01:42:11,220 --> 01:42:13,450
her dad was never around.

926
01:42:14,460 --> 01:42:16,120
He was very busy?

927
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:17,680
Very!

928
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:23,290
Don't bring up the past.

929
01:42:23,930 --> 01:42:25,800
I was a real no-hoper.

930
01:42:25,870 --> 01:42:28,430
But things are better now.

931
01:42:28,870 --> 01:42:31,340
And will be better for your child.

932
01:42:32,670 --> 01:42:34,230
Erxi, drink up.

933
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:38,400
Help yourself.

934
01:42:41,650 --> 01:42:43,580
I had the photo framed.

935
01:42:48,420 --> 01:42:51,260
We haven't taken a photo in years.

936
01:42:51,390 --> 01:42:52,920
This is great.

937
01:42:58,630 --> 01:43:01,530
After the child is born...

938
01:43:02,170 --> 01:43:04,400
have a photo taken every year.

939
01:43:05,710 --> 01:43:08,370
We've no photos of Fengxia as a child.

940
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:09,570
Okay.

941
01:43:10,180 --> 01:43:13,110
Fengxia, after the child is born...

942
01:43:13,650 --> 01:43:16,240
have a photo taken every year.

943
01:43:21,490 --> 01:43:24,050
Dad, I saw Chunsheng yesterday.

944
01:43:25,990 --> 01:43:28,830
He's been arrested as a capitalist.

945
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,830
They held a public trial against him.

946
01:43:32,070 --> 01:43:34,930
We have to draw a line between us and him.

947
01:43:39,310 --> 01:43:40,670
Of course.

948
01:43:41,410 --> 01:43:43,540
There's always been a line.

949
01:43:44,410 --> 01:43:47,280
Haven't had much to do with him for years.

950
01:44:06,270 --> 01:44:07,430
Fugui!

951
01:44:11,370 --> 01:44:12,770
Who's there?

952
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:14,210
Chunsheng.

953
01:44:15,540 --> 01:44:16,640
Who?

954
01:44:16,710 --> 01:44:18,040
Chunsheng.

955
01:44:23,150 --> 01:44:24,780
What do you want?

956
01:44:26,950 --> 01:44:28,850
Come out for a second.

957
01:44:31,030 --> 01:44:32,960
Just say what you want.

958
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:35,820
It'll just take a minute.

959
01:45:08,360 --> 01:45:09,490
Well?

960
01:45:10,100 --> 01:45:11,330
Fugui...

961
01:45:12,330 --> 01:45:15,060
I've always felt terrible about Youqing.

962
01:45:17,340 --> 01:45:21,300
I've often tried to give you money.
You'd never accept it.

963
01:45:23,180 --> 01:45:26,310
It's all in this account. Take it.

964
01:45:29,650 --> 01:45:31,350
You came for this?

965
01:45:33,390 --> 01:45:34,820
Take this...

966
01:45:36,220 --> 01:45:38,420
and my heart will be at ease.

967
01:45:40,860 --> 01:45:43,060
All my debts will have been paid.

968
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:45,220
What do you mean?

969
01:45:47,530 --> 01:45:49,870
Yesterday, my wife killed herself.

970
01:45:52,370 --> 01:45:53,900
Killed herself?

971
01:45:54,910 --> 01:45:55,970
Why?

972
01:45:57,340 --> 01:45:58,830
I don't know.

973
01:45:58,980 --> 01:46:00,910
Have you seen her body?

974
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:02,340
No.

975
01:46:03,720 --> 01:46:05,980
I just got an official notice.

976
01:46:09,290 --> 01:46:11,190
You mustn't lose hope.

977
01:46:12,990 --> 01:46:15,460
Don't go getting any stupid ideas.

978
01:46:17,730 --> 01:46:20,170
You must bear it, no matter what!

979
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,470
You can't take that road yourself.

980
01:46:27,040 --> 01:46:29,270
I don't want to live anymore!

981
01:46:30,540 --> 01:46:32,010
You just have to!

982
01:46:33,850 --> 01:46:36,650
We've been through the valley of death.

983
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:38,950
Coming out alive wasn't easy.

984
01:46:42,390 --> 01:46:43,720
Can't you see?

985
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:52,060
Let's say we accept this money.

986
01:46:52,130 --> 01:46:55,430
Keep it for us. There's plenty of time.

987
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:01,870
I know how difficult it must be...

988
01:47:03,080 --> 01:47:06,140
but you've got to pull through...

989
01:47:07,280 --> 01:47:09,180
you've got to bear it!

990
01:47:11,620 --> 01:47:13,450
I don't think I can.

991
01:47:20,090 --> 01:47:22,220
Chunsheng, it's cold.

992
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:24,400
Come inside.

993
01:47:25,170 --> 01:47:26,660
Yes, come in.

994
01:47:26,970 --> 01:47:29,200
No, thank you, I've got to go.

995
01:47:30,100 --> 01:47:32,040
I snuck out just now...

996
01:47:32,110 --> 01:47:33,900
and better get back.

997
01:47:41,380 --> 01:47:44,350
Chunsheng, remember...

998
01:47:44,550 --> 01:47:46,540
you still owe us a life!

999
01:47:47,020 --> 01:47:49,080
You've got to value yours!

1000
01:48:14,410 --> 01:48:16,680
Mr. Niu, is your wife at home?

1001
01:48:16,750 --> 01:48:17,810
Yes.

1002
01:48:19,690 --> 01:48:21,650
What are these eggs for?

1003
01:48:22,160 --> 01:48:25,990
Fengxia's about to have a baby.
It's to thank the matchmaker!

1004
01:48:26,060 --> 01:48:27,720
Fengxia's about to give birth?

1005
01:48:27,790 --> 01:48:29,280
Time does fly!

1006
01:48:29,360 --> 01:48:32,200
Erxi sent word from the hospital.

1007
01:48:32,430 --> 01:48:35,060
She's in labor. We're on our way there.

1008
01:48:36,070 --> 01:48:38,560
Another working class member on the way!

1009
01:48:38,810 --> 01:48:40,830
So we've got to get going.

1010
01:48:41,310 --> 01:48:43,780
We'll bring the baby to see you.

1011
01:48:44,340 --> 01:48:46,900
- But you won't stay?
- No, thanks.

1012
01:48:57,360 --> 01:49:00,090
Never mind. Let's go. Don't worry.

1013
01:49:02,760 --> 01:49:05,290
Why's she crying?

1014
01:49:05,370 --> 01:49:06,960
What's happened?

1015
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:09,330
I'm no longer head of the township.

1016
01:49:09,400 --> 01:49:12,860
They say I'm a capitalist.

1017
01:49:13,470 --> 01:49:15,440
I have to confess my crimes.

1018
01:49:15,510 --> 01:49:16,940
You! Crimes?

1019
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:19,670
You, a capitalist?

1020
01:49:20,210 --> 01:49:21,940
Everyone knows you.

1021
01:49:22,420 --> 01:49:24,480
I have faith in the Party.

1022
01:49:24,650 --> 01:49:27,480
I've always followed Chairman Mao's path.

1023
01:49:30,860 --> 01:49:33,450
When will they let you return?

1024
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:38,130
Let's not talk about it.

1025
01:49:38,200 --> 01:49:39,860
You go to Fengxia.

1026
01:49:40,270 --> 01:49:42,060
Go now, I'll be okay.

1027
01:49:52,050 --> 01:49:55,340
Niu, don't let it get to you. Take care!

1028
01:49:56,050 --> 01:49:59,180
We'll visit you after
she's out of the hospital.

1029
01:50:01,420 --> 01:50:05,520
Send her my very best. She's producing
a little revolutionary successor.

1030
01:50:05,990 --> 01:50:08,390
Everything's fine and normal.

1031
01:50:08,700 --> 01:50:12,460
They say she's great. No problems.

1032
01:50:13,670 --> 01:50:15,360
When is it due?

1033
01:50:15,700 --> 01:50:18,300
From the contractions, not right now.

1034
01:50:21,370 --> 01:50:23,710
Fengxia, don't be nervous.

1035
01:50:23,940 --> 01:50:25,610
Won't hurt a bit.

1036
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:29,010
Remember to breathe and push.

1037
01:50:29,680 --> 01:50:34,420
When you're pushing, bite on a towel.

1038
01:50:35,660 --> 01:50:37,350
Where's the towel?

1039
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:46,430
Here, bite on this. It'll save your teeth.

1040
01:50:47,400 --> 01:50:49,830
Do whatever the doctor tells you.

1041
01:50:50,040 --> 01:50:52,130
It'll be quick if you push.

1042
01:50:52,210 --> 01:50:54,830
Do as Mommy says and push.

1043
01:50:54,910 --> 01:50:56,640
Everything will be fine.

1044
01:50:56,940 --> 01:50:59,970
What's this about pushing?
Too early for pushing!

1045
01:51:00,410 --> 01:51:03,750
And what's this shouting? Out!

1046
01:51:04,350 --> 01:51:06,250
Go wait in the corridor.

1047
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:08,010
Okay, we're going.

1048
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:11,860
- Sorry for the trouble.
- It's our job.

1049
01:51:11,930 --> 01:51:13,220
Sit down.

1050
01:51:25,040 --> 01:51:26,840
They're all so young.

1051
01:51:27,370 --> 01:51:29,000
Are they nurses?

1052
01:51:29,640 --> 01:51:31,470
Who examined Fengxia?

1053
01:51:31,550 --> 01:51:32,770
They did.

1054
01:51:32,850 --> 01:51:35,110
You haven't seen any doctors?

1055
01:51:35,180 --> 01:51:36,240
No.

1056
01:51:37,080 --> 01:51:39,310
Go ask where the doctors are.

1057
01:51:39,490 --> 01:51:41,580
We must find a good doctor.

1058
01:51:42,520 --> 01:51:44,550
They've been locked away.

1059
01:51:44,930 --> 01:51:48,020
The Red Guards are in control!

1060
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:50,760
No doctors?

1061
01:51:58,310 --> 01:52:01,100
Comrade, are there any doctors?

1062
01:52:01,170 --> 01:52:02,160
Yes, us!

1063
01:52:02,240 --> 01:52:03,400
I mean, older ones.

1064
01:52:03,480 --> 01:52:06,930
They're all reactionaries.
We've overthrown them.

1065
01:52:07,350 --> 01:52:10,610
Relax. Your wife's fine. We can handle this.

1066
01:52:18,930 --> 01:52:21,360
Erxi, I'm worried.

1067
01:52:22,030 --> 01:52:24,900
Fengxia's a mute.

1068
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,300
Can these young people cope?

1069
01:52:28,370 --> 01:52:30,500
We need an experienced doctor.

1070
01:52:30,570 --> 01:52:33,770
Even if he only stands by, we would relax.

1071
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:39,240
Have to get one out.

1072
01:52:40,550 --> 01:52:41,710
Let me think.

1073
01:53:08,170 --> 01:53:11,300
What is he doing here?
No reactionaries allowed!

1074
01:53:13,180 --> 01:53:14,940
Wang Bin! Stand up!

1075
01:53:19,020 --> 01:53:22,050
This is the same Wang Bin
who once insulted...

1076
01:53:22,460 --> 01:53:26,360
me and my wife,
saying she wasn't fit to reproduce.

1077
01:53:27,560 --> 01:53:29,360
How vile can you get?

1078
01:53:31,030 --> 01:53:33,160
We dragged him here today...

1079
01:53:33,300 --> 01:53:36,270
to educate him, to criticize him...

1080
01:53:37,340 --> 01:53:39,900
and to let him witness her giving birth.

1081
01:53:39,970 --> 01:53:42,910
To show him the heirs
of this new, Red world.

1082
01:53:43,110 --> 01:53:45,410
The working class is really something!

1083
01:53:45,480 --> 01:53:47,910
Wang Bin, don't make any trouble.

1084
01:53:48,150 --> 01:53:49,510
Don't move.

1085
01:53:49,580 --> 01:53:51,910
I wouldn't dare.

1086
01:54:03,300 --> 01:54:05,290
That's professor Wang...

1087
01:54:05,500 --> 01:54:07,230
head of obstetrics.

1088
01:54:15,010 --> 01:54:17,030
Dr. Wang, don't be afraid.

1089
01:54:17,440 --> 01:54:19,440
I was putting on a show.

1090
01:54:20,180 --> 01:54:21,700
We're not accusing you.

1091
01:54:21,780 --> 01:54:23,770
My wife's having a baby.

1092
01:54:24,020 --> 01:54:26,350
I wanted you here for her sake.

1093
01:54:30,290 --> 01:54:31,880
No, it's better if I wear it.

1094
01:54:31,960 --> 01:54:33,480
Let me wear it!

1095
01:54:41,970 --> 01:54:43,200
Go ask.

1096
01:54:50,010 --> 01:54:52,070
I'm just going to see him.

1097
01:55:09,900 --> 01:55:11,450
He's all right.

1098
01:55:13,870 --> 01:55:14,930
Just hungry.

1099
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,090
Hasn't been fed for three days!

1100
01:55:17,170 --> 01:55:19,070
I'll go buy some buns.

1101
01:55:45,730 --> 01:55:47,200
Where's Erxi?

1102
01:55:47,270 --> 01:55:49,030
They've gone to eat.

1103
01:55:49,300 --> 01:55:50,600
How's Fengxia?

1104
01:55:50,670 --> 01:55:52,470
They say she's fine.

1105
01:55:52,910 --> 01:55:53,900
Want one?

1106
01:55:53,970 --> 01:55:56,070
Give them to Dr. Wang.

1107
01:55:56,740 --> 01:55:58,730
Dr. Wang, have some buns.

1108
01:56:04,580 --> 01:56:06,880
Take your time. There's plenty.

1109
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:24,060
Fengxia's child won't be mute, will he?

1110
01:56:24,270 --> 01:56:26,900
Of course not. She wasn't born that way.

1111
01:56:27,870 --> 01:56:29,900
Will the baby be crippled?

1112
01:56:30,310 --> 01:56:33,680
Erxi's is a work-related injury.
It's not hereditary.

1113
01:56:34,010 --> 01:56:36,780
Anyway, it's bad luck to talk like that.

1114
01:56:38,120 --> 01:56:39,710
Why not use this time...

1115
01:56:39,790 --> 01:56:42,120
to think of a name for the kid?

1116
01:56:44,490 --> 01:56:46,390
What name do you like?

1117
01:56:49,260 --> 01:56:50,730
"Don't Gamble."

1118
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:53,130
- Don't be stupid.
- It was a joke.

1119
01:56:53,630 --> 01:56:55,530
What name do you like?

1120
01:57:07,580 --> 01:57:08,950
"Little Bun."

1121
01:57:09,380 --> 01:57:11,250
You just say anything!

1122
01:57:11,550 --> 01:57:13,250
That's not a name!

1123
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:15,350
But it's a tradition.

1124
01:57:15,590 --> 01:57:17,950
Cat, Dog or Little Bun...

1125
01:57:18,460 --> 01:57:22,020
are not recorded in the Register of Names.

1126
01:57:22,660 --> 01:57:24,190
He'd know for sure.

1127
01:57:24,260 --> 01:57:27,790
He doesn't know those kids exist...

1128
01:57:28,300 --> 01:57:30,000
so they don't die.

1129
01:57:30,600 --> 01:57:32,830
That's what the old folks say.

1130
01:57:35,580 --> 01:57:37,740
Okay, then Little Bun it is.

1131
01:57:37,810 --> 01:57:40,110
For now, anyway.

1132
01:57:41,150 --> 01:57:44,410
Later, his dad can give him a proper name.

1133
01:58:05,770 --> 01:58:08,430
Where's the family of Xu Fengxia?

1134
01:58:09,740 --> 01:58:11,400
It's a boy, 7.9 pounds.

1135
01:58:11,480 --> 01:58:13,710
- Already?
- We didn't hear a sound.

1136
01:58:13,780 --> 01:58:15,650
We said it would be fine!

1137
01:58:15,720 --> 01:58:18,310
Comrade, how's my daughter?

1138
01:58:18,380 --> 01:58:20,380
Fine. Mother and son are fine.

1139
01:58:20,450 --> 01:58:22,510
Is he normal?

1140
01:58:22,590 --> 01:58:23,680
Absolutely.

1141
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:25,490
Can we see them?

1142
01:58:25,560 --> 01:58:27,550
No, there's danger of infection.

1143
01:58:27,630 --> 01:58:30,390
Let us have a quick peek, please?

1144
01:58:30,460 --> 01:58:33,130
Please, comrade, just one peek?

1145
01:58:59,690 --> 01:59:02,990
Dad! Mom! Has she given birth?

1146
01:59:03,060 --> 01:59:04,260
It's a boy.

1147
01:59:04,330 --> 01:59:07,890
They are fine. He's 7.9 pounds.

1148
01:59:07,970 --> 01:59:09,590
Do you hear him?

1149
01:59:09,670 --> 01:59:11,330
Are they in there?

1150
01:59:11,870 --> 01:59:13,460
- Have a look.
- Not yet!

1151
01:59:13,540 --> 01:59:15,530
Please, I'm the father!

1152
01:59:15,610 --> 01:59:18,240
It doesn't matter. We're not done yet.

1153
01:59:18,310 --> 01:59:23,270
Wait outside. When we're finished,
you can see her as much as you want.

1154
01:59:24,550 --> 01:59:27,020
We'll see them soon.

1155
01:59:28,290 --> 01:59:29,720
Is it a boy?

1156
01:59:30,660 --> 01:59:32,280
Yes, 7.9 pounds!

1157
01:59:32,660 --> 01:59:35,290
- How is he?
- They're both fine!

1158
01:59:35,360 --> 01:59:37,690
Erxi, you're a lucky man!

1159
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:40,890
My son was only 5.5 pounds.

1160
01:59:40,970 --> 01:59:43,160
7.9 pounds is excellent.

1161
01:59:43,240 --> 01:59:45,760
If you get a car from the factory...

1162
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:48,400
we can drive Fengxia home.

1163
01:59:48,640 --> 01:59:50,010
Good idea.

1164
01:59:53,950 --> 01:59:57,440
Erxi, seeing as they are both fine...

1165
01:59:57,520 --> 01:59:59,850
why don't you see Dr. Wang back.

1166
02:00:00,790 --> 02:00:02,380
What's with him?

1167
02:00:11,630 --> 02:00:13,390
He ate too quickly.

1168
02:00:16,500 --> 02:00:18,530
Did he eat all seven buns?

1169
02:00:18,600 --> 02:00:21,130
Yes, just gobbled them up.

1170
02:00:21,540 --> 02:00:23,630
Quick, get some water.

1171
02:00:25,310 --> 02:00:28,540
You two get the car, we'll be fine.

1172
02:00:40,990 --> 02:00:42,590
Have some water.

1173
02:00:44,660 --> 02:00:46,360
Careful, it's hot.

1174
02:00:55,640 --> 02:00:57,580
Some water should help.

1175
02:00:59,180 --> 02:01:00,810
Why'd he do that?

1176
02:01:00,880 --> 02:01:04,180
He's been locked up without food.
He scoffed those buns.

1177
02:01:05,750 --> 02:01:07,380
Drink it slowly.

1178
02:01:10,360 --> 02:01:11,580
Help us!

1179
02:01:11,660 --> 02:01:15,250
She's bleeding! We don't know what to do.

1180
02:01:15,330 --> 02:01:16,520
Quick!

1181
02:01:34,450 --> 02:01:36,810
Don't panic. Think of something.

1182
02:01:37,250 --> 02:01:40,980
We're just students.
We don't know what to do.

1183
02:01:44,920 --> 02:01:47,090
Wouldn't Dr. Wang know?

1184
02:01:47,160 --> 02:01:48,920
Yes, he's a professor.

1185
02:01:49,130 --> 02:01:50,690
He'd know for sure.

1186
02:01:50,760 --> 02:01:52,960
He'll know.

1187
02:01:53,030 --> 02:01:54,930
Get Dr. Wang over here.

1188
02:02:02,710 --> 02:02:04,770
What's wrong with him? What happened?

1189
02:02:04,840 --> 02:02:06,310
He's eaten too much.

1190
02:02:06,380 --> 02:02:08,040
What do you mean?

1191
02:02:08,180 --> 02:02:10,950
He gobbled up seven buns.

1192
02:02:11,020 --> 02:02:12,450
He was starving.

1193
02:02:12,520 --> 02:02:14,880
But he was okay after the water.

1194
02:02:15,150 --> 02:02:18,020
It was the water that did it.

1195
02:02:18,620 --> 02:02:20,680
Never mind. Drag him over!

1196
02:02:21,490 --> 02:02:23,720
She's bleeding! Quick!

1197
02:02:33,640 --> 02:02:36,270
Please, Doctor, please!

1198
02:02:37,740 --> 02:02:39,540
You'll pull through!

1199
02:02:40,650 --> 02:02:42,200
It's all right.

1200
02:02:42,680 --> 02:02:44,950
Mommy's here. Don't be afraid.

1201
02:02:52,290 --> 02:02:53,590
Dr. Wang!

1202
02:02:53,990 --> 02:02:56,150
- Feeling better?
- Not at all.

1203
02:02:57,430 --> 02:02:58,660
Oxygen.

1204
02:03:07,310 --> 02:03:11,070
Fengxia! You'll pull through.
Mommy's here. Don't be afraid.

1205
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:15,210
Please, Doctor, she's my only daughter.

1206
02:03:15,520 --> 02:03:18,250
The only child I have left.

1207
02:03:26,860 --> 02:03:30,420
Fengxia! Mommy's here. Don't be afraid.

1208
02:03:48,010 --> 02:03:53,040
Some years later...

1209
02:04:30,190 --> 02:04:32,680
Grandpa! It's crooked again.

1210
02:04:33,590 --> 02:04:34,790
Is it?

1211
02:04:34,860 --> 02:04:36,290
I'll fix it.

1212
02:04:37,100 --> 02:04:39,260
Take the medicine to Granny.

1213
02:04:45,740 --> 02:04:47,800
Granny, your medicine.

1214
02:04:48,310 --> 02:04:49,770
Back already?

1215
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:51,570
Has Little Bun been a good boy?

1216
02:04:52,110 --> 02:04:54,580
I delivered 10 thermoses of water.

1217
02:04:56,280 --> 02:04:58,010
Such a good little boy.

1218
02:04:58,080 --> 02:04:59,850
Ten whole thermoses.

1219
02:05:04,360 --> 02:05:06,450
Have you had your medicine?

1220
02:05:07,390 --> 02:05:09,020
I'll make lunch.

1221
02:05:09,900 --> 02:05:11,290
Little Bun...

1222
02:05:11,360 --> 02:05:12,920
give me a hand.

1223
02:05:13,200 --> 02:05:14,860
I light the fire?

1224
02:05:15,900 --> 02:05:18,770
Yes, and I'll make some noodles.

1225
02:05:21,840 --> 02:05:24,610
I want to visit Fengxia's grave again...

1226
02:05:25,610 --> 02:05:28,310
and take Little Bun's photos...

1227
02:05:28,980 --> 02:05:30,510
to show her.

1228
02:05:31,180 --> 02:05:33,150
He's another year older.

1229
02:05:33,220 --> 02:05:35,410
Fine, I'll let Erxi know.

1230
02:05:43,430 --> 02:05:46,060
Little Bun! Hold onto those chicks.

1231
02:05:47,270 --> 02:05:50,030
We should've bought them
on the way home.

1232
02:05:50,540 --> 02:05:52,660
Now we've got to carry them!

1233
02:05:53,370 --> 02:05:55,400
Careful! Don't drop them!

1234
02:05:56,240 --> 02:05:57,770
Are you happy?

1235
02:05:59,910 --> 02:06:02,470
Grandpa, where will the chicks live?

1236
02:06:03,080 --> 02:06:04,710
Where will they live?

1237
02:06:04,780 --> 02:06:07,720
I'll find a home for them when we get back.

1238
02:06:25,970 --> 02:06:27,730
Youqing eats dumplings.

1239
02:06:27,810 --> 02:06:29,800
Fengxia looks at photos.

1240
02:06:30,440 --> 02:06:33,710
Little Bun, do you know who Youqing is?

1241
02:06:33,850 --> 02:06:35,040
Uncle.

1242
02:06:35,280 --> 02:06:37,770
- And Fengxia?
- Mommy.

1243
02:06:39,290 --> 02:06:40,980
What a clever boy!

1244
02:06:41,050 --> 02:06:43,780
Granny, why all the photos for Fengxia?

1245
02:06:46,360 --> 02:06:48,620
Before you were born...

1246
02:06:49,730 --> 02:06:51,890
Granny said to mommy that...

1247
02:06:52,600 --> 02:06:55,070
she should take a photo every year.

1248
02:06:56,970 --> 02:06:59,730
If I hadn't given Dr. Wang those buns...

1249
02:07:00,240 --> 02:07:02,500
everything would've been fine.

1250
02:07:03,380 --> 02:07:05,740
He could have saved our Fengxia.

1251
02:07:06,210 --> 02:07:08,370
He's a professor, after all.

1252
02:07:09,120 --> 02:07:11,450
He always carries on like this.

1253
02:07:11,980 --> 02:07:13,350
It's okay.

1254
02:07:16,120 --> 02:07:18,590
We shouldn't have given him water.

1255
02:07:19,060 --> 02:07:21,530
People say, once you drink water...

1256
02:07:21,590 --> 02:07:24,260
one bun in the stomach turns to seven.

1257
02:07:25,300 --> 02:07:27,290
Dr. Wang ate seven buns.

1258
02:07:27,870 --> 02:07:30,560
Seven times seven is 49.

1259
02:07:31,670 --> 02:07:33,430
It's much too much.

1260
02:07:35,780 --> 02:07:38,510
Erxi, is it true that Dr. Wang...

1261
02:07:38,840 --> 02:07:41,780
won't eat buns, only rice now?

1262
02:07:42,550 --> 02:07:44,180
Not just buns...

1263
02:07:44,280 --> 02:07:46,310
anything made from wheat.

1264
02:07:48,550 --> 02:07:50,650
Rice costs more than wheat.

1265
02:07:50,720 --> 02:07:52,950
What a food bill he must have.

1266
02:08:14,750 --> 02:08:16,980
- I'll make dinner.
- I'll help.

1267
02:08:17,780 --> 02:08:21,010
No, you're tired. You two have a rest.
I'll do it.

1268
02:08:21,950 --> 02:08:24,510
Little Bun, behave yourself.

1269
02:08:26,230 --> 02:08:28,790
Grandpa, where'll we put the chicks?

1270
02:08:30,530 --> 02:08:31,890
Let's see.

1271
02:08:43,510 --> 02:08:45,200
How about in here?

1272
02:08:46,080 --> 02:08:48,310
This box is bigger, isn't it?

1273
02:08:49,350 --> 02:08:51,980
They'll have more room to run around.

1274
02:08:53,050 --> 02:08:54,950
Then they'll eat more.

1275
02:08:57,090 --> 02:08:59,110
And soon they'll grow up.

1276
02:09:05,330 --> 02:09:08,060
When will they grow up?

1277
02:09:08,470 --> 02:09:09,830
Very soon.

1278
02:09:10,340 --> 02:09:11,630
And then?

1279
02:09:12,270 --> 02:09:13,670
And then...

1280
02:09:16,210 --> 02:09:18,770
the chickens will turn into geese...

1281
02:09:18,910 --> 02:09:21,540
and the geese will turn into sheep...

1282
02:09:21,950 --> 02:09:25,010
and the sheep will turn into oxen.

1283
02:09:25,550 --> 02:09:27,310
And after the oxen?

1284
02:09:28,550 --> 02:09:30,080
After oxen...

1285
02:09:32,190 --> 02:09:35,320
After oxen, Little Bun will grow up.

1286
02:09:36,500 --> 02:09:38,490
I want to ride on an ox's back!

1287
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:40,830
You will ride on an ox's back.

1288
02:09:41,300 --> 02:09:43,730
Little Bun won't ride on an ox...

1289
02:09:43,800 --> 02:09:46,130
he'll ride trains and planes...

1290
02:09:46,470 --> 02:09:49,840
and life will get better and better.
